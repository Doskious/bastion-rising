All of my friends think me mad, I fear, and supposedly it\'s bad luck to start a voyage like mine without someone to see you off. I had thought to at least see Dabrent on the quay to try to talk me out of going, but it seems even he has given up. I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me. The ship is fascinating, though, and as my home now dwindles towards the horizon I have no regrets in my decision. Regrets about lacking the funds to secure faster passage aplenty, but no qualms about my plan.</p>\n			<p>\"Go to Ilizmagorti, locate some unexplored ruins in the region, join or start an expedition to them, document my findings, and join the Pathfinders.\" Hm, now that I write it out like that, it does seem a touch ... grandiose. Then again, the letter from Master Devers seemed to indicate that, in addition to providing the location of several ruins, he might be able to point me in the right direction for an expedition. Tatadi said I was being too trusting. We\'ll see if she was right, I suppose.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle backstory\" id=\"journalEntryBackstory1\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/06/22</span><span class=\"journalTitleText\">An abrupt turn of events... </span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>I thought I would be meeting Devers in Ilizmagorti, but his note, left three days ago at the Red Casque, said he\'d had to leave with his ship for Port Peril. Hopefully, the Jenivere will put in there long enough for me to catch him up. I\'m now apparently supposed to be meeting him at the Formidably Maid saloon? If he\'s not there, I\'ll have to look elsewhere for assistance - I haven\'t the funds to keep chasing him down the coast...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"section2\"><h1 class=\"ooc-data\">Life on the Wormwood</h1>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/07/03</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Wormwood Day 3</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Assault for breakfast</span>, <span class=\"journalSubTitle\">peppered with bravado</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>I\'ve finally managed to scrounge some paper to keep a proper record of my fate... While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\n			<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\n			<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\n			<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\n			<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \"Mad Harry Bonny\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \"Mad Harry\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\n			<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\n			<p>My findings follow...</p>\n			<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\n				<br>\"Ratline\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\n				<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear. He beat the snot out of Mad Harry last night.\n				<br>Giffer Tibs {One eyed F Halfling}, friendlyish with Rosie and Conchabar. Olderish, largely indifferent.\n				<br>\"Badger\" Medlar {F Half-elf}, probably oldest person on the boat, has gray hair shaved into stripes. She\'s been talking tonight with Chiveeka {F Mwangi}, a middle-aged woman with an indifferent attitude.\n				<br>The poor simpleton chained up belowdecks is Owlbear, and is kept on board as Mr Plugh\'s \"pet.\" Mr. Plugh is our ... esteemed ... first officer. He gives me the creeps even worse than Master Scourge.\n				<br>I got a reaction to being the Cook\'s Mate more than once: The Last Cook\'s Mate disappeared suddenly and is speculated to have \"fed the crew\" in a more literal sense... Wonderful. \n			</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/07/04</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Wormwood Day 4</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Observing the Crew</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>I need to be more concise to conserve paper until I can obtain more... Less exposition! </p>\n			<p>Afternoon Activities: \n				<br>Observation: Ambrose drinks all day; Grokk drinks heavily in the afternoon and doesn\'t stop... I managed to get my compass, lantern, and signet ring back from Grokk.\n				<br>Neryce Mends things... Another spellcaster! \"Barefoot\" Samms Toppin is the first crew member to ask for a personal object to be mended. Neryce also tried to get some of her stuff from Grokk, successfully, I think.\n				<br>Varnai worked in the rigging today and chatted with Conchabar. Mad Harry was today\'s Ratcatcher with young Jack Scrimshaw. \n			</p>\n			<p>In the late morning, Jack Scrimshaw hustled up to the middle deck from the bilges with signs of a bite wound. While he headed above, Mad Harry headed down to the bilges with me and Buster, where we discovered six <a style=\"color: black; text-decoration: none;\" class=\"freeCaptain\" href=\"http://princessbride.wikia.com/wiki/Rodents_of_unusual_size\" target=\"_blank\">rodents of unusual size<span class=\"tooltip\">Though not encountered in the Fire Swamp, oddly...</span></a>. Varnai, Neryce, and Crimson Cogward joined us {at Scourge\'s direction!} and we dispatched the infestation. Mad Harry was bitten several times, but survived to recover his Armor from Grokk. Varnai recovered his crossbow, I handed mine back along with my lantern, but recovered my compass and ring. After the scrum, Neryce persuaded Grokk to give Rosie her fiddle back, which earned her persistent gratitude. </p>\n			<p>Evening Events:\n				<br>Conchabar, Rosie, and Varnai perform for the crew. There\'s some dancing. Neryce joins in the entertainment.\n				<br>I tried to talk to Badger {the half-elven gal} again, but she didn\'t really seem to care. She said that in her experience, the best thing was to just not care. Disappointing, but I guess that\'s her way of dealing with our situation. I wonder how long she\'s been a pirate... I doubt she\'d tell me if I asked though. \n			</p>\n			<p>Perhaps tomorrow will bring more insights. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/07/05</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Wormwood Day 5</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Fight and a purse won</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Afternoon Activities: \n				<br>I tried to make friends with Crimson Cogward with mixed results.\n				<br>Mad Harry looked for an opportunistic friendly conversation...\n				<br>Aisla was our Lookout today in the Crow\'s Nest.\n				<br>Neryce was today\'s ratcatcher, but visited Ambrose in the galley.\n				<br>Varnai was in the bilges, accompanied by one of Plugh\'s goons {a lady}. Syl maybe? \n			</p>\n			<p>Evening Events:\n				<br>Plugh and cronies dragged Owlbear up to the mess and threw a 100g purse behind Owlbear in a fight. Mad Harry stood up to the challenge, and traded haymakers with the brute. It became evident that Owlbear was blind in his left eye, which Mad Harry was able to exploit to a degree. Owlbear tried to escape the fight but was pushed back into the ring, where Mad Harry decked him with a third punch. There was a great commotion. Plugh\'s cronies dragged Owlbear back below-decks. Master Scourge lashes random crew members in the crowd to quell the commotion. Mad Harry is congratulated; Neryce has been given a share of Conchabar\'s winnings and Mad Harry\'s other Knuckleduster, which she returned to him. \n			</p>\n			<p>After the fight, we all agreed to try to find out more about the unknown cronies... with limited success. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/07/06</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Wormwood Day 6</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Rainy and Nasty</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Nothing much happens during the day, it\'s all we can do to keep up with ship\'s tasks in the inclement weather. </p>\n			<p>In the evening, Crimson Cogward approaches Mad Harry for an arm-wrestling match for funsies.

Tensions rose and Master Scourge arrived, to dispense lashes to Varnai and Mad Harry. Sandarra piped up and tried to take Varnai\'s lashes, but only got awarded some of her own.

Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing.

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\n			<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\n			<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\n			<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\n			<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\n			<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\n			<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\n			<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\n			<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\n			<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\n			<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\n			<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\n			<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\n			<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\n			<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\n			<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\n			<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\n			<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\n			<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\n			<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\n			<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\n			<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\n			<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\n			<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling. The compartment is revealed to be only just large enough for a person to fit uncomfortably, but it actually contained several heavily laden bags filled with uncut gems and a small wooden box. The box, on investigation, is found to contain a very large amount of narcotics. </p>\n			<p>The chainmail worn by their captain, Aspar Tharkidor, showed magical emanations, and was seized by Aisla; I acquired a new suit of Masterwork Studded Leather from a fallen Marine and the captain\'s masterwork rapier. </p>\n			<p>Having obtained Plunder and sufficient crew, I recommended to the Captain that we should make our way to Sangore, as the largest port in close sailing distance.

The craft appeared to be abandoned, with a fishing net still deployed. </p>\n			<p>Varnai, Neryce, and Buster swam down to investigate what appears to be a sinking lifeboat, and discovered that it had been hulled as well. </p>\n			<p>I asked Buster to investigate inside the trawler, and he stealthily discovered six fish-people {Sahuagin} lurking below-decks, wielding tridents, and apparently waiting for something to come down the stairs. As Buster was withdrawing, he heard one of the Sahuagin identify his presence, and booked it out of there, but he was detected. </p>\n			<p>I recommended a pre-emptive strike against the breach with our remaining incendiary bolt, which the Captain authorized. Making up for the earlier misfire, Aisla expertly nailed the breach, incinerating all but one of the foul creatures.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\n			<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \"Pete\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\n			<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\n			<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\" ... </p>\n		<blockquote><p>\n			<strong style=\"font-size: larger;\">Deep Platinum</strong>\n				<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \"black smokers.\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \n			</p></blockquote>\n			<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\n			<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\n			<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\n			<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\n			<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\n			<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\n			<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \"would do anything to recover.\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\n			<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\n			<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\n			<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\n			<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \"improved potency\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\n			<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\n			<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure...

The crew finds this entertaining.</p>\n			<p>Below-decks in the afternoon, Owlbear is playing with a crustacean, but he also appears to have been injured somehow. I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\n			<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\n			<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease. No additional effects transpire, however.</p>\n			<p>In the evening, a storm rolls in from the North. Varnai orders a course change to the South to avoid the worst of the gale. We are buffeted by severe weather, but it is, so far, not so bad as the tempests we suffered in our early days at sea.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/18</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Bloody Exchange</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>I suggested that we check the storm\'s wake for ships that might have foundered in the weather. Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\n			<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\n			<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\n			<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale. They appear to have retreated from the rails, and Captain Tideweaver orders the Allegiance to close for boarding...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/18</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Boarding the Devil\'s Pallor</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>As we grapple to the side of the Devil\'s Pallor, the enemy crew does not seem to be willing to engage us and is remaining below-decks. Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\n			<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\n			<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\n			<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves. Should this happen on a third occasion, I do not know how well the crew will take it...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/19</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Approach of the Deathknell</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>The party to celebrate our success continued into the wee hours of the morning. Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\n			<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \"Deathknell\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\n			<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\n		<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\n			<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\n			<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm. Morale is low, and murmurs of doom are becoming pervasive. The crew clearly does not believe they are able to effectively combat the undead. Regardless of the threat of the Deathknell, the oncoming storm is looking to hit before dinnertime. Varnai spoke to the crew and roused their spirits, and we proceeded handily with securing the ship for the gale.</p>\n			<p>The storm hit in the midafternoon, and while the ship rolled in the storm, a ships\' bell tolling from aft is plainly heard. The Deathknell approaches...</p>\n			<p>Under Varnai\'s guidance, the Allegiance comes about to try to catch the Deathknell flatfooted...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Wake of the Deathknell</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>As we came about and loosed a barrage of ballastae bolts; we were in turn harpooned by a massive shot. The Deathknell began to submerge and Mad Harry leapt out onto the harpoon lodged in our hull and sliced at the rope connecting our ships. He clearly hit, but didn\'t cleave the rope; Buster leapt out to finish the job, successfully, and was caught by Harry before he could fall into the waves.  Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\n			<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\n			<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"section9\"><h1 class=\"ooc-data\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

With Sandarra ill, I asked Tanos to assist Neryce.</p>\n			<p>I\'ve noticed that the crew continues to experience morale issues, grumbling about the trials we\'ve faced - first the undead then the stirrings of a plague. Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\n			<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake. We will likely take two days to make landfall.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/27</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Troubling developments</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Six more sick Petes today, as well as Ratline, Reef, Fishmouth, and Chiveeka. Sandarra is recovering well, as is the initial Sick Pete; Fipps is probably recovering the best of our ill crew. Conchabar has worsened, however.</p>\n			<p>During the afternoon, Blind Ben makes an argument to Varnai in favor of, in the event of a death due to illness, a cannibalistic consumption of the deceaced \"to improve our strength and resiliency to the plague.\" Mad Harry challenged his premise, asking if consuming the dead who were to weak to resist the disease would help at all. Blind Ben responded that he \"always felt stronger after eating, but that our true strength is in our bones, and if we can\'t use that strength we should share it.\" Varnai\'s face was priceless.</p>\n			<p>Ten\'n\'one was discovered attempting to break quarantine to visit Fishmouth, and was warned away by Mad Harry. Buster reported his attitude as \'shifty\' ...</p>\n			<p>As sunset draws near, Lookout Pete shouts down the \"sails-ho\" call. Sails are indeed visible to the west, and appears to be coming on slightly faster than we can make way. As the last rays of sunlight wane, the ship is identified as a four-masted Chelish Man\'o\'war. We\'ve hoisted the yellow Plague Flag and lit the braziers to clearly illuminate it, but the Chelish ship has clearly turned to overtake us...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/28</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A sheltered cove</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Over the night, our pursuer has gained on us, but we have 6 more sick Petes and the Chelish have gained on us further.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\n			<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\n			<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \"aid\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\n			<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\n			<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\n			<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today.

The witch-doctor returned today with curative assistance for three of our crew as well as a bangle he tells us to hand in the quarantine area to suck out the illness that remains with the crew.</p>\n			<p>Rain has arrived as forecast, and appears to be getting worse roughly as expected. Neryce tells us that the rain should last through tomorrow evening, and should clear up thereafter. Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\n			<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.  Neryce, Aisla, and Buster rejoined us, and we continued to glide out of the cove with the tide.</p>\n			<p>Our departure was detected, and despite Neryce\'s conjured mists, several ballista shots landed home on the hull, but Varnai concluded his long-winded transmutation and we were able to slip away without more than a subsequent half-hearted volley from the incapacitated Dominator.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/30</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A successful escape</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Two more Petes have recovered today, and no further Petes are reporting signs of the illness.

I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\n			<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain. It claimed that the cost would be harmless to the bound bargainer over the long run, but we all decided the offer was not sanguine.</p>\n			<p>We decided to bury the thing, and disembarked to bury the sarcophagus. The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well. Neryce saved him at the brink of death, as we subdued the beetle, but left it alive and stabilized to hopefully serve as a guardian over the entombed silver sarcophagus.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"section12\"><h1 class=\"ooc-data\">Additional Adventures</h1>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/19</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Returning to Quent</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>With the Keelboat in tandem, we returned briefly to Quent to carouse again and vend our various items of plunder. My negotiations were rather successful, and we have put out to sea again carrying reagents for the creation of alchemical concoctions, valued at 4,000 measures, for Aisla\'s endeavors as well as 8,000 measures-worth of materials for my own studies into the enchantment and enhancement of armor and weaponry.</p>\n			<p>My initial work on my crossbow seems satisfactory, and I was able to augment Varnai\'s Vindictive Harpoon with conductive tracery and inlay. This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ... I wonder if the constant presence of Buster (taking a turn as a tern), Rotgut, and Neryce\'s albatross (whose name I\'ve yet to learn) are taking too severe a toll on our Bosun...</p>\n			<p>Our second visit to Quent was just as pleasant as the first, and it is with bolstered spirits that we embark again. I\'ve advised an easterly course around Motaku Isle, cutting through the large unnamed lagoon south of Dahak\'s Fang and then into the long southwest passage marked on the Chelish charts as \'Cuthroat Run\' - I believe that the Wormwood transited this passage at least in part on our initial journey from Port Peril.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Kelp Monster!</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>This morning, in the wee hours, our ship was attacked by what I can only describe as a fragrant Kelp Monster. Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\n			<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time. Periodically, though, it will cease to function until returned to the surface. Aisla dubbed it the \'Helm of Stylish Drowning\' and the name seems to have stuck. A marvel at naming things, our Alchemist.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Unexpected Settlement</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>As we entered the archipelago south of Dahak\'s Fang, lookouts sight a fair-sized town heretofore unknown to us (including Ambrose)! None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \"The Fish Man\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\n			<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\n			<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull. Dinner will be tasty tonight, I think.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Giant Crab</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>After dispatching the crab handily with well-placed strikes from Harry and Buster and a beautifully placed bomb from Aisla, the harvest of crab increased our plunder by a sizable amount.

With the recent \"alliance\" of the pirates of the Shackles with Sargava it has diminished in relevance as a point of defense for the Shackles. The most recent Free Captain to inhabit the Keep was Bertram Smythee, aka. Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\n			<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\n			<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\n			<p><span class=\"ooc-data\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\n			<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\n			<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta.

After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably.

The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\n			<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\n			<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\n			<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \"purple and blue\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\n			<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\n			<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\n			<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict.

While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\n			<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\n			<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\n			<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\n			<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \"Mad Harry Bonny\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \"Mad Harry\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\n			<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\n			<p>My findings follow...</p>\n			<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\n				<br>\"Ratline\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\n				<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear.

Varnai, Neryce, and Crimson Cogward joined us {at Scourge\'s direction!} and we dispatched the infestation. Mad Harry was bitten several times, but survived to recover his Armor from Grokk. Varnai recovered his crossbow, I handed mine back along with my lantern, but recovered my compass and ring. After the scrum, Neryce persuaded Grokk to give Rosie her fiddle back, which earned her persistent gratitude. </p>\n			<p>Evening Events:\n				<br>Conchabar, Rosie, and Varnai perform for the crew.

We found a path leading inland, past a ruined tent smelling of rotting corpses but containing only piles of clothes and rugs. We refrained from further examination at my urging, as I was nervous about our encounter last night with the undead wenches from the Chelish ship. </p>\n			<p>Further along the path, we came to the ruins of a bridge which Buster was able to ford with a rope, but at which we also encountered two large frogs which tried to eat us. We dispatched them without being injured and continued along the path to reach an abandoned village with an overgrown safe harbor on the north shore. Aisla went back to the jolly boat to move it to the north shore while the rest of us moved to scale the northeastern promontory. Upon reaching the top, we sighted grindylow at the jolly boat and hustled back down to meet Aisla just past our rope bridge. We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\n			<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\n			<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\n			<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \"feast on these morsels\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\n			<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\n			<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\n			<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\n			<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\n			<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake. The fool took it, and was shocked to discover that the tables had been turned upon him... Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\n			<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace?

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\n			<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\n			<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\n			<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\n			<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\n			<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\n			<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\n			<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\n			<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\n			<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\n			<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\n			<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\n			<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\n			<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\n			<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\n			<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\n			<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\n			<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\n			<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\n			<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\n			<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\n			<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\n			<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\n			<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling. The compartment is revealed to be only just large enough for a person to fit uncomfortably, but it actually contained several heavily laden bags filled with uncut gems and a small wooden box. The box, on investigation, is found to contain a very large amount of narcotics. </p>\n			<p>The chainmail worn by their captain, Aspar Tharkidor, showed magical emanations, and was seized by Aisla; I acquired a new suit of Masterwork Studded Leather from a fallen Marine and the captain\'s masterwork rapier. </p>\n			<p>Having obtained Plunder and sufficient crew, I recommended to the Captain that we should make our way to Sangore, as the largest port in close sailing distance.

The survivor was observed by Buster scuttling off towards the briny depths, and we sailed on. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/07</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Rude Awakening</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Rosie reported the death of a Sahuagin that attacked the ship. Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\n			<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \"Pete\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\n			<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\n			<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\" ... </p>\n		<blockquote><p>\n			<strong style=\"font-size: larger;\">Deep Platinum</strong>\n				<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \"black smokers.\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \n			</p></blockquote>\n			<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\n			<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund. Varnai said he\'d consider the thought... </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/12</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Gremlin amongst us?</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Conchabar reported discovering several ships stores depleted unexpectedly, and Kipper drank slightly too much and wailed heavily on Pete, to the point that Sandarra had to heal him back to life... </p>\n			<p>Mad Harry took Kipper to task, while I resolved to stay up tonight so that Buster could watch the ships stores in secret. </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"section8\"><h1 class=\"ooc-data\">Proper Piracy</h1>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/13</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Pillar of Smoke</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>After an uneventful night of assisting Buster in watching the ship\'s Stores, the dawn brought a pillar smoke into view. A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\n			<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\n			<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\n			<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\n			<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\n			<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \"would do anything to recover.\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\n			<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\n			<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\n			<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\n			<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \"improved potency\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\n			<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\n			<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure... As the twilight deepened, a lone ship\'s bell was heard tolling across the vacant waves... </p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/14</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Owlbear Injured</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>During the morning, fog is seen to the north, near the horizon, but it is not significant and has no apparent impact on ship\'s operations.</p>\n			<p>During the afternoon, the ship is passed by a breaching whale. The crew finds this entertaining.</p>\n			<p>Below-decks in the afternoon, Owlbear is playing with a crustacean, but he also appears to have been injured somehow. I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\n			<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\n			<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease. No additional effects transpire, however.</p>\n			<p>In the evening, a storm rolls in from the North. Varnai orders a course change to the South to avoid the worst of the gale. We are buffeted by severe weather, but it is, so far, not so bad as the tempests we suffered in our early days at sea.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/18</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Bloody Exchange</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>I suggested that we check the storm\'s wake for ships that might have foundered in the weather. Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\n			<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\n			<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\n			<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale. They appear to have retreated from the rails, and Captain Tideweaver orders the Allegiance to close for boarding...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/18</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Boarding the Devil\'s Pallor</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>As we grapple to the side of the Devil\'s Pallor, the enemy crew does not seem to be willing to engage us and is remaining below-decks. Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\n			<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\n			<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\n			<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves. Should this happen on a third occasion, I do not know how well the crew will take it...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/19</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Approach of the Deathknell</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>The party to celebrate our success continued into the wee hours of the morning. Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\n			<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \"Deathknell\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\n			<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\n		<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\n			<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\n			<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm. Morale is low, and murmurs of doom are becoming pervasive. The crew clearly does not believe they are able to effectively combat the undead. Regardless of the threat of the Deathknell, the oncoming storm is looking to hit before dinnertime. Varnai spoke to the crew and roused their spirits, and we proceeded handily with securing the ship for the gale.</p>\n			<p>The storm hit in the midafternoon, and while the ship rolled in the storm, a ships\' bell tolling from aft is plainly heard. The Deathknell approaches...</p>\n			<p>Under Varnai\'s guidance, the Allegiance comes about to try to catch the Deathknell flatfooted...</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The Wake of the Deathknell</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>As we came about and loosed a barrage of ballastae bolts; we were in turn harpooned by a massive shot. The Deathknell began to submerge and Mad Harry leapt out onto the harpoon lodged in our hull and sliced at the rope connecting our ships. He clearly hit, but didn\'t cleave the rope; Buster leapt out to finish the job, successfully, and was caught by Harry before he could fall into the waves.  Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\n			<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\n			<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"section9\"><h1 class=\"ooc-data\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\n			<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake.

Blind Ben responded that he \"always felt stronger after eating, but that our true strength is in our bones, and if we can\'t use that strength we should share it.\" Varnai\'s face was priceless.</p>\n			<p>Ten\'n\'one was discovered attempting to break quarantine to visit Fishmouth, and was warned away by Mad Harry.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\n			<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\n			<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \"aid\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\n			<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\n			<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success.

Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours.

Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\n			<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.  Neryce, Aisla, and Buster rejoined us, and we continued to glide out of the cove with the tide.</p>\n			<p>Our departure was detected, and despite Neryce\'s conjured mists, several ballista shots landed home on the hull, but Varnai concluded his long-winded transmutation and we were able to slip away without more than a subsequent half-hearted volley from the incapacitated Dominator.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/09/30</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A successful escape</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>Two more Petes have recovered today, and no further Petes are reporting signs of the illness.

The man is clearly aged, but the timeless age of a properly venerable fellow. He introduced himself as Doren, and requested passage out of Quent, with no destination in mind. I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\n			<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain. It claimed that the cost would be harmless to the bound bargainer over the long run, but we all decided the offer was not sanguine.</p>\n			<p>We decided to bury the thing, and disembarked to bury the sarcophagus. The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well. Neryce saved him at the brink of death, as we subdued the beetle, but left it alive and stabilized to hopefully serve as a guardian over the entombed silver sarcophagus.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"section12\"><h1 class=\"ooc-data\">Additional Adventures</h1>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/19</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Returning to Quent</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>With the Keelboat in tandem, we returned briefly to Quent to carouse again and vend our various items of plunder.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ... I wonder if the constant presence of Buster (taking a turn as a tern), Rotgut, and Neryce\'s albatross (whose name I\'ve yet to learn) are taking too severe a toll on our Bosun...</p>\n			<p>Our second visit to Quent was just as pleasant as the first, and it is with bolstered spirits that we embark again. I\'ve advised an easterly course around Motaku Isle, cutting through the large unnamed lagoon south of Dahak\'s Fang and then into the long southwest passage marked on the Chelish charts as \'Cuthroat Run\' - I believe that the Wormwood transited this passage at least in part on our initial journey from Port Peril.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Kelp Monster!</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>This morning, in the wee hours, our ship was attacked by what I can only describe as a fragrant Kelp Monster. Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\n			<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time. Periodically, though, it will cease to function until returned to the surface. Aisla dubbed it the \'Helm of Stylish Drowning\' and the name seems to have stuck. A marvel at naming things, our Alchemist.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">Unexpected Settlement</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>As we entered the archipelago south of Dahak\'s Fang, lookouts sight a fair-sized town heretofore unknown to us (including Ambrose)! None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \"The Fish Man\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\n			<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\n			<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull. Dinner will be tasty tonight, I think.</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"entry\">\n		<h2 class=\"clickableJournalTitle\"><span class=\"gameDate\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\"journalContext\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\"journalTitleText\">A Giant Crab</span><span class=\"ooc-data\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\n		<div class=\"body\">\n			<p>After dispatching the crab handily with well-placed strikes from Harry and Buster and a beautifully placed bomb from Aisla, the harvest of crab increased our plunder by a sizable amount.

With the recent \"alliance\" of the pirates of the Shackles with Sargava it has diminished in relevance as a point of defense for the Shackles. The most recent Free Captain to inhabit the Keep was Bertram Smythee, aka. Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\n			<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\n			<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\n			<p><span class=\"ooc-data\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\n			<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\n			<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta.

After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably.

The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\n			<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\n			<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\n			<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \"purple and blue\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\n			<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\n			<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\n			<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict.

All of my friends think me mad, I fear, and supposedly it\'s bad luck to start a voyage like mine without someone to see you off. I had thought to at least see Dabrent on the quay to try to talk me out of going, but it seems even he has given up. I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me. The ship is fascinating, though, and as my home now dwindles towards the horizon I have no regrets in my decision. Regrets about lacking the funds to secure faster passage aplenty, but no qualms about my plan.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\\"Go to Ilizmagorti, locate some unexplored ruins in the region, join or start an expedition to them, document my findings, and join the Pathfinders.\\\" Hm, now that I write it out like that, it does seem a touch ... grandiose. Then again, the letter from Master Devers seemed to indicate that, in addition to providing the location of several ruins, he might be able to point me in the right direction for an expedition. Tatadi said I was being too trusting. We\'ll see if she was right, I suppose.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle backstory\\\" id=\\\"journalEntryBackstory1\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/06/22</span><span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">An abrupt turn of events... </span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I thought I would be meeting Devers in Ilizmagorti, but his note, left three days ago at the Red Casque, said he\'d had to leave with his ship for Port Peril. Hopefully, the Jenivere will put in there long enough for me to catch him up. I\'m now apparently supposed to be meeting him at the Formidably Maid saloon? If he\'s not there, I\'ll have to look elsewhere for assistance - I haven\'t the funds to keep chasing him down the coast...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section2\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">Life on the Wormwood</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 3</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Assault for breakfast</span>, <span class=\\\"journalSubTitle\\\">peppered with bravado</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I\'ve finally managed to scrounge some paper to keep a proper record of my fate... While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear. He beat the snot out of Mad Harry last night.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Giffer Tibs {One eyed F Halfling}, friendlyish with Rosie and Conchabar. Olderish, largely indifferent.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Badger\\\" Medlar {F Half-elf}, probably oldest person on the boat, has gray hair shaved into stripes. She\'s been talking tonight with Chiveeka {F Mwangi}, a middle-aged woman with an indifferent attitude.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>The poor simpleton chained up belowdecks is Owlbear, and is kept on board as Mr Plugh\'s \\\"pet.\\\" Mr. Plugh is our ... esteemed ... first officer. He gives me the creeps even worse than Master Scourge.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>I got a reaction to being the Cook\'s Mate more than once: The Last Cook\'s Mate disappeared suddenly and is speculated to have \\\"fed the crew\\\" in a more literal sense... Wonderful. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 4</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Observing the Crew</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I need to be more concise to conserve paper until I can obtain more...

I managed to get my compass, lantern, and signet ring back from Grokk.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Neryce Mends things... Another spellcaster! \\\"Barefoot\\\" Samms Toppin is the first crew member to ask for a personal object to be mended. Neryce also tried to get some of her stuff from Grokk, successfully, I think.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Varnai worked in the rigging today and chatted with Conchabar. Mad Harry was today\'s Ratcatcher with young Jack Scrimshaw. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the late morning, Jack Scrimshaw hustled up to the middle deck from the bilges with signs of a bite wound. While he headed above, Mad Harry headed down to the bilges with me and Buster, where we discovered six <a style=\\\"color: black; text-decoration: none;\\\" class=\\\"freeCaptain\\\" href=\\\"http://princessbride.wikia.com/wiki/Rodents_of_unusual_size\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">rodents of unusual size<span class=\\\"tooltip\\\">Though not encountered in the Fire Swamp, oddly...</span></a>. Varnai, Neryce, and Crimson Cogward joined us {at Scourge\'s direction!} and we dispatched the infestation. Mad Harry was bitten several times, but survived to recover his Armor from Grokk. Varnai recovered his crossbow, I handed mine back along with my lantern, but recovered my compass and ring. After the scrum, Neryce persuaded Grokk to give Rosie her fiddle back, which earned her persistent gratitude. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Evening Events:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Conchabar, Rosie, and Varnai perform for the crew. There\'s some dancing. Neryce joins in the entertainment.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>I tried to talk to Badger {the half-elven gal} again, but she didn\'t really seem to care. She said that in her experience, the best thing was to just not care. Disappointing, but I guess that\'s her way of dealing with our situation. I wonder how long she\'s been a pirate... I doubt she\'d tell me if I asked though. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Perhaps tomorrow will bring more insights. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 5</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Fight and a purse won</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Afternoon Activities: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>I tried to make friends with Crimson Cogward with mixed results.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Mad Harry looked for an opportunistic friendly conversation...\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Aisla was our Lookout today in the Crow\'s Nest.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Neryce was today\'s ratcatcher, but visited Ambrose in the galley.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Varnai was in the bilges, accompanied by one of Plugh\'s goons {a lady}.

Mad Harry stood up to the challenge, and traded haymakers with the brute. It became evident that Owlbear was blind in his left eye, which Mad Harry was able to exploit to a degree. Owlbear tried to escape the fight but was pushed back into the ring, where Mad Harry decked him with a third punch. There was a great commotion. Plugh\'s cronies dragged Owlbear back below-decks. Master Scourge lashes random crew members in the crowd to quell the commotion. Mad Harry is congratulated; Neryce has been given a share of Conchabar\'s winnings and Mad Harry\'s other Knuckleduster, which she returned to him. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the fight, we all agreed to try to find out more about the unknown cronies... with limited success. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/06</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 6</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Rainy and Nasty</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Nothing much happens during the day, it\'s all we can do to keep up with ship\'s tasks in the inclement weather. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the evening, Crimson Cogward approaches Mad Harry for an arm-wrestling match for funsies.

Tensions rose and Master Scourge arrived, to dispense lashes to Varnai and Mad Harry. Sandarra piped up and tried to take Varnai\'s lashes, but only got awarded some of her own.

We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake. The fool took it, and was shocked to discover that the tables had been turned upon him... Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace? Plugh was strung up, still alive but grievously unconscious, from the rigging as an example to the remaining crew. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To: Master and Officers, The Allegiance<br>From: Purser, The Allegiance </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Please find below a review of various matters that might benefit from your input and consideration. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Revised Crew Compliment:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Officers: </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Captain: Varnai Tideweaver</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>First Mate: Ner\\u00ff\\u00e7e Tr\\u00edtonsd\\u00f4tt\\u00ecr</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Gunner, Second Mate: Aisla </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master-at-Arms, Bosun: Mad Harry Bonny</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Navigator, Purser, Chief Engineer: Emalliandra</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Chef: Ambrose Kroop</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Suggested Officer Promotions:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chaplain, Doctor: Sandarra Quinn</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Quartermaster: Conchabar</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Bosun\'s Mate: Rosie</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Gunner\'s Mate: Kipper</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>General Crew {Riggers, Swabs, Bilge-rats}:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chiveeka </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Larry {the Rahadoumi sailor of the vacant, distant stare}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Curly {the Rahadoumi sailor who misses his booze}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Moe {the Rahadoumi sailor who saw her two best friends killed by us and is probably still mad about that...}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Ratline Ratsburger</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps Chumlet</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Maheem </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Narwhal </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Patch Patchsalt </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mascot: Owlbear</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Total Crew Compliment: 19, 20 counting Owlbear or Buster, 21 counting Owlbear and Buster.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Spellcasters aboard able to use Animate Tools: 2 \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Notes on formerly hostile crew members:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps: Bully personality, may harbor a grudge for his fall from favor...

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling.

The box, on investigation, is found to contain a very large amount of narcotics. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The chainmail worn by their captain, Aspar Tharkidor, showed magical emanations, and was seized by Aisla; I acquired a new suit of Masterwork Studded Leather from a fallen Marine and the captain\'s masterwork rapier. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Having obtained Plunder and sufficient crew, I recommended to the Captain that we should make our way to Sangore, as the largest port in close sailing distance.

Making up for the earlier misfire, Aisla expertly nailed the breach, incinerating all but one of the foul creatures.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure... As the twilight deepened, a lone ship\'s bell was heard tolling across the vacant waves... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/14</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Owlbear Injured</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>During the morning, fog is seen to the north, near the horizon, but it is not significant and has no apparent impact on ship\'s operations.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>During the afternoon, the ship is passed by a breaching whale. The crew finds this entertaining.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Below-decks in the afternoon, Owlbear is playing with a crustacean, but he also appears to have been injured somehow. I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Varnai spoke to the crew and roused their spirits, and we proceeded handily with securing the ship for the gale.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The storm hit in the midafternoon, and while the ship rolled in the storm, a ships\' bell tolling from aft is plainly heard.

The Deathknell began to submerge and Mad Harry leapt out onto the harpoon lodged in our hull and sliced at the rope connecting our ships. He clearly hit, but didn\'t cleave the rope; Buster leapt out to finish the job, successfully, and was caught by Harry before he could fall into the waves.  Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake. We will likely take two days to make landfall.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/27</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Troubling developments</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Six more sick Petes today, as well as Ratline, Reef, Fishmouth, and Chiveeka.

Blind Ben responded that he \\\"always felt stronger after eating, but that our true strength is in our bones, and if we can\'t use that strength we should share it.\\\" Varnai\'s face was priceless.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Ten\'n\'one was discovered attempting to break quarantine to visit Fishmouth, and was warned away by Mad Harry.

Sails are indeed visible to the west, and appears to be coming on slightly faster than we can make way. As the last rays of sunlight wane, the ship is identified as a four-masted Chelish Man\'o\'war. We\'ve hoisted the yellow Plague Flag and lit the braziers to clearly illuminate it, but the Chelish ship has clearly turned to overtake us...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/28</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A sheltered cove</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Over the night, our pursuer has gained on us, but we have 6 more sick Petes and the Chelish have gained on us further.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today. Repairs have proceeded well in spite of the weather. The witch-doctor returned today with curative assistance for three of our crew as well as a bangle he tells us to hand in the quarantine area to suck out the illness that remains with the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rain has arrived as forecast, and appears to be getting worse roughly as expected. Neryce tells us that the rain should last through tomorrow evening, and should clear up thereafter. Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.  Neryce, Aisla, and Buster rejoined us, and we continued to glide out of the cove with the tide.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our departure was detected, and despite Neryce\'s conjured mists, several ballista shots landed home on the hull, but Varnai concluded his long-winded transmutation and we were able to slip away without more than a subsequent half-hearted volley from the incapacitated Dominator.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A successful escape</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Two more Petes have recovered today, and no further Petes are reporting signs of the illness.

It was here that I caught up to our group, having finished today\'s negotiations for the sale of our plunder, and discovered the pleasurable company of Captain Merril Pegsworthy. On hearing of our encounter with the Deathknell, he related a similar experience for one of his subordinate ships.

The man is clearly aged, but the timeless age of a properly venerable fellow. He introduced himself as Doren, and requested passage out of Quent, with no destination in mind. I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well. This leaves us with 59 Junior Officers and Crew, one mascot, and one passenger.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section11\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">The Sealed Sarcophagus</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Foggy Day...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The fog today , while not so thick on as the gloaming we encountered around the Deathknell, was still thick enough to masque the approach of a midsize fishing vessel flying no colors off the port bow.

Varnai is having none of this, however, and after righting our course we are in pursuit once more.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the Allegiance closes again, tendrils of fire strafe our sails just before Mad Harry orders the grappling - it seems they have a spellcaster...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/17</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Incedental Retrospective</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The past several days have been odd to say the least.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On capturing the keelboat, which proved to be crewed entirely by spellcasters who fought to the death (taking three of our Petes with them), in a shielded chamber in their hold, we discovered a sealed silver sarcophagus inlaid with intricate runes in deep platinum, radiating highly potent necromancy. After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain. It claimed that the cost would be harmless to the bound bargainer over the long run, but we all decided the offer was not sanguine.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We decided to bury the thing, and disembarked to bury the sarcophagus. The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well. Neryce saved him at the brink of death, as we subdued the beetle, but left it alive and stabilized to hopefully serve as a guardian over the entombed silver sarcophagus.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section12\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">Additional Adventures</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/19</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Returning to Quent</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>With the Keelboat in tandem, we returned briefly to Quent to carouse again and vend our various items of plunder.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

I\'ve advised an easterly course around Motaku Isle, cutting through the large unnamed lagoon south of Dahak\'s Fang and then into the long southwest passage marked on the Chelish charts as \'Cuthroat Run\' - I believe that the Wormwood transited this passage at least in part on our initial journey from Port Peril.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Kelp Monster!</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>This morning, in the wee hours, our ship was attacked by what I can only describe as a fragrant Kelp Monster. Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time. Periodically, though, it will cease to function until returned to the surface. Aisla dubbed it the \'Helm of Stylish Drowning\' and the name seems to have stuck.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

With the recent \\\"alliance\\\" of the pirates of the Shackles with Sargava it has diminished in relevance as a point of defense for the Shackles. The most recent Free Captain to inhabit the Keep was Bertram Smythee, aka. Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot.

Sails rise from a bluff, gilded platform. Close examination of the ship through the Farglass indicates that this is a vessel of Osiriani design. As the ship closes, we can see thugs in over-embellished armor moving about between buildings on deck, and they have raised a flag of parlay. The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans.

I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me.

While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear.

Owlbear tried to escape the fight but was pushed back into the ring, where Mad Harry decked him with a third punch. There was a great commotion. Plugh\'s cronies dragged Owlbear back below-decks. Master Scourge lashes random crew members in the crowd to quell the commotion.

We found a path leading inland, past a ruined tent smelling of rotting corpses but containing only piles of clothes and rugs. We refrained from further examination at my urging, as I was nervous about our encounter last night with the undead wenches from the Chelish ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Further along the path, we came to the ruins of a bridge which Buster was able to ford with a rope, but at which we also encountered two large frogs which tried to eat us. We dispatched them without being injured and continued along the path to reach an abandoned village with an overgrown safe harbor on the north shore. Aisla went back to the jolly boat to move it to the north shore while the rest of us moved to scale the northeastern promontory. Upon reaching the top, we sighted grindylow at the jolly boat and hustled back down to meet Aisla just past our rope bridge. We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake. The fool took it, and was shocked to discover that the tables had been turned upon him... Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace? Plugh was strung up, still alive but grievously unconscious, from the rigging as an example to the remaining crew. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To: Master and Officers, The Allegiance<br>From: Purser, The Allegiance </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Please find below a review of various matters that might benefit from your input and consideration. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Revised Crew Compliment:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Officers: </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Captain: Varnai Tideweaver</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>First Mate: Ner\\u00ff\\u00e7e Tr\\u00edtonsd\\u00f4tt\\u00ecr</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Gunner, Second Mate: Aisla </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master-at-Arms, Bosun: Mad Harry Bonny</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Navigator, Purser, Chief Engineer: Emalliandra</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Chef: Ambrose Kroop</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Suggested Officer Promotions:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chaplain, Doctor: Sandarra Quinn</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Quartermaster: Conchabar</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Bosun\'s Mate: Rosie</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Gunner\'s Mate: Kipper</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>General Crew {Riggers, Swabs, Bilge-rats}:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chiveeka </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Larry {the Rahadoumi sailor of the vacant, distant stare}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Curly {the Rahadoumi sailor who misses his booze}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Moe {the Rahadoumi sailor who saw her two best friends killed by us and is probably still mad about that...}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Ratline Ratsburger</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps Chumlet</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Maheem </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Narwhal </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Patch Patchsalt </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mascot: Owlbear</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Total Crew Compliment: 19, 20 counting Owlbear or Buster, 21 counting Owlbear and Buster.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Spellcasters aboard able to use Animate Tools: 2 \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Notes on formerly hostile crew members:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps: Bully personality, may harbor a grudge for his fall from favor...

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling. The compartment is revealed to be only just large enough for a person to fit uncomfortably, but it actually contained several heavily laden bags filled with uncut gems and a small wooden box.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure...

I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today.

Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.

I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain.

The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta.

After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably.

As the ship closes, we can see thugs in over-embellished armor moving about between buildings on deck, and they have raised a flag of parlay. The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans.

While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear.

We found a path leading inland, past a ruined tent smelling of rotting corpses but containing only piles of clothes and rugs. We refrained from further examination at my urging, as I was nervous about our encounter last night with the undead wenches from the Chelish ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Further along the path, we came to the ruins of a bridge which Buster was able to ford with a rope, but at which we also encountered two large frogs which tried to eat us. We dispatched them without being injured and continued along the path to reach an abandoned village with an overgrown safe harbor on the north shore. Aisla went back to the jolly boat to move it to the north shore while the rest of us moved to scale the northeastern promontory. Upon reaching the top, we sighted grindylow at the jolly boat and hustled back down to meet Aisla just past our rope bridge. We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake.

Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace?

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive.

While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure...

I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today.

Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.

I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain.

The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta.

After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably.

The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans.

I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me.

While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear.

Owlbear tried to escape the fight but was pushed back into the ring, where Mad Harry decked him with a third punch. There was a great commotion. Plugh\'s cronies dragged Owlbear back below-decks. Master Scourge lashes random crew members in the crowd to quell the commotion.

We found a path leading inland, past a ruined tent smelling of rotting corpses but containing only piles of clothes and rugs. We refrained from further examination at my urging, as I was nervous about our encounter last night with the undead wenches from the Chelish ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Further along the path, we came to the ruins of a bridge which Buster was able to ford with a rope, but at which we also encountered two large frogs which tried to eat us. We dispatched them without being injured and continued along the path to reach an abandoned village with an overgrown safe harbor on the north shore. Aisla went back to the jolly boat to move it to the north shore while the rest of us moved to scale the northeastern promontory. Upon reaching the top, we sighted grindylow at the jolly boat and hustled back down to meet Aisla just past our rope bridge. We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake. The fool took it, and was shocked to discover that the tables had been turned upon him... Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace? Plugh was strung up, still alive but grievously unconscious, from the rigging as an example to the remaining crew. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To: Master and Officers, The Allegiance<br>From: Purser, The Allegiance </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Please find below a review of various matters that might benefit from your input and consideration. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Revised Crew Compliment:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Officers: </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Captain: Varnai Tideweaver</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>First Mate: Ner\\u00ff\\u00e7e Tr\\u00edtonsd\\u00f4tt\\u00ecr</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Gunner, Second Mate: Aisla </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master-at-Arms, Bosun: Mad Harry Bonny</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Navigator, Purser, Chief Engineer: Emalliandra</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Chef: Ambrose Kroop</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Suggested Officer Promotions:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chaplain, Doctor: Sandarra Quinn</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Quartermaster: Conchabar</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Bosun\'s Mate: Rosie</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Gunner\'s Mate: Kipper</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>General Crew {Riggers, Swabs, Bilge-rats}:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chiveeka </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Larry {the Rahadoumi sailor of the vacant, distant stare}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Curly {the Rahadoumi sailor who misses his booze}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Moe {the Rahadoumi sailor who saw her two best friends killed by us and is probably still mad about that...}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Ratline Ratsburger</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps Chumlet</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Maheem </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Narwhal </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Patch Patchsalt </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mascot: Owlbear</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Total Crew Compliment: 19, 20 counting Owlbear or Buster, 21 counting Owlbear and Buster.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Spellcasters aboard able to use Animate Tools: 2 \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Notes on formerly hostile crew members:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps: Bully personality, may harbor a grudge for his fall from favor...

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure...

I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today.

Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.

I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain.

The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta. After some catching up with William about his father (who William clearly believes to be dead), Varnai manages to steer the conversation to the subject of our blood vendetta against Harrigan.</p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">Infamy: 10 | Disrepute: 10</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Lady Agasta was unwilling to merely enter an alliance, but proposed a political marriage to Captain Varnai for a period of one year, during which time co-comittent use of the spouse\'s property is unrestricted. After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably. Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla released fireworks to ... celebrate.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/24</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Becalmed</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Becalmed on the fever sea, a lookout has sighted a pod of dolphins in the distance. Neryce indicated that they appear to be fleeing, though, and as we watched a toothy maw on a long sinuous neck breaks the surface long enough to swallow a dolphin. Neryce identifies the creature as a Sea Serpent, an incredibly rare, mythical inhabitant of the oceans. Varnai summoned a breeze at this point, and we were able to sail away slowly.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section13\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">The Merchant of Sothis</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Gilded Gull</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A ship is sighted on the horizon unlike any normal ship. Sails rise from a bluff, gilded platform. Close examination of the ship through the Farglass indicates that this is a vessel of Osiriani design. As the ship closes, we can see thugs in over-embellished armor moving about between buildings on deck, and they have raised a flag of parlay. The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans. Hopefully the Captain has gotten along better with Jeg...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/26</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Back to the Rock</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Some of the crew were late to duty this morning, perhaps after too long on the Jeweled Bird, but this is not perhaps a horrible thing. We\'re making way reasonably well, given the speed to which Lacuni\'s craft is limited. Sandarra is clearly distraught by the conditions on the Bird, as was Doren from his visit.

Harry has sussed out that she is some sort of devout and reportedly took a vow of silence. Ten\'n\'one does report that there is a large-ish section of the undership that might be Lacuni\'s quarters or might be a vault, and that it was always guarded by at minimum six men. He also reported seeing a great vareity in the slave population, with some appearing to bear tattoos from the Shackles.

He did appear to be mollified slightly by the history of the place, but his overall lack of regard for the fort is nearly palpable.
