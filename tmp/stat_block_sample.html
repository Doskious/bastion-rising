    <hr/>Born to a family of adventurers in Absolom, Emalliandra was brought up on stories of Azlant and the Test of the Starstone. When she was 23, after a heated argument with the Chief Librarian, she applied to the Pathfinder Society. Only after her evaluation was underway did she learn that her parents were retired members, and that as a result of this and her easy access to the Grand Lodge, her evaluation team was expecting top-flight performance. In this, however, her impulsive decision served her poorly, and she was denied entry.
    <br/>
    <br/> This failure turned her whimsical notion into an actual life-changing experience, and for the following five years, she worked to develop any kind of skill set that would allow her to adventure. Despite her intellectual capacity, all of the Wizards she sought out were unable to teach her to work any magic (plenty of theory, but no actual magic). She found herself unable to properly learn martial skills, as she tended to over-think her reactions. Unable to carry a tune in a bucket, she was similarly put off by any serious religious undertakings. It was while she was searching for a skilled detective or spy to whom she might be apprenticed that she "found" Buster. After taking the Hedgehog home to care for him, she brought Buster on her subsequent attempts to apprentice herself to a skilled teacher.
    <br/>
    <br/> One day, unsuccessful in her search for intrigue, she was assaulted by street toughs, and Buster rescued her. Buster explained afterwards that while Emalliandra had been born with the potential to be a Summoner, her focus had never turned inwards to discover that power, until that afternoon when her life had flashed before her eyes.

    <br/> Buoyed by a new sense of ability, Emma gathered her remaining funds and booked passage to Ilizmagorti in search of lost ruins. Her research had put her in contact with a source with a map in Ilizmatogori, and she wrote to arrange to acquire a map to the ruins she hoped would make her name for the Society. When she arrived, however, her contact had left a message asking her if they could meet in Port Peril, so she returned to the docks and boarded another ship to proceed. Upon her arrival in Port Peril, she found the people and the drinks far rougher than she had anticipated...
