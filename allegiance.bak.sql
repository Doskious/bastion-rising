All of my friends think me mad, I fear, and supposedly it\'s bad luck to start a voyage like mine without someone to see you off. I had thought to at least see Dabrent on the quay to try to talk me out of going, but it seems even he has given up. I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me. The ship is fascinating, though, and as my home now dwindles towards the horizon I have no regrets in my decision. Regrets about lacking the funds to secure faster passage aplenty, but no qualms about my plan.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\\"Go to Ilizmagorti, locate some unexplored ruins in the region, join or start an expedition to them, document my findings, and join the Pathfinders.\\\" Hm, now that I write it out like that, it does seem a touch ... grandiose. Then again, the letter from Master Devers seemed to indicate that, in addition to providing the location of several ruins, he might be able to point me in the right direction for an expedition. Tatadi said I was being too trusting. We\'ll see if she was right, I suppose.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle backstory\\\" id=\\\"journalEntryBackstory1\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/06/22</span><span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">An abrupt turn of events... </span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I thought I would be meeting Devers in Ilizmagorti, but his note, left three days ago at the Red Casque, said he\'d had to leave with his ship for Port Peril. Hopefully, the Jenivere will put in there long enough for me to catch him up. I\'m now apparently supposed to be meeting him at the Formidably Maid saloon? If he\'s not there, I\'ll have to look elsewhere for assistance - I haven\'t the funds to keep chasing him down the coast...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section2\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">Life on the Wormwood</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 3</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Assault for breakfast</span>, <span class=\\\"journalSubTitle\\\">peppered with bravado</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I\'ve finally managed to scrounge some paper to keep a proper record of my fate... While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear. He beat the snot out of Mad Harry last night.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Giffer Tibs {One eyed F Halfling}, friendlyish with Rosie and Conchabar. Olderish, largely indifferent.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Badger\\\" Medlar {F Half-elf}, probably oldest person on the boat, has gray hair shaved into stripes. She\'s been talking tonight with Chiveeka {F Mwangi}, a middle-aged woman with an indifferent attitude.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>The poor simpleton chained up belowdecks is Owlbear, and is kept on board as Mr Plugh\'s \\\"pet.\\\" Mr. Plugh is our ... esteemed ... first officer. He gives me the creeps even worse than Master Scourge.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>I got a reaction to being the Cook\'s Mate more than once: The Last Cook\'s Mate disappeared suddenly and is speculated to have \\\"fed the crew\\\" in a more literal sense... Wonderful. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 4</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Observing the Crew</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I need to be more concise to conserve paper until I can obtain more...

I managed to get my compass, lantern, and signet ring back from Grokk.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Neryce Mends things... Another spellcaster! \\\"Barefoot\\\" Samms Toppin is the first crew member to ask for a personal object to be mended. Neryce also tried to get some of her stuff from Grokk, successfully, I think.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Varnai worked in the rigging today and chatted with Conchabar. Mad Harry was today\'s Ratcatcher with young Jack Scrimshaw. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the late morning, Jack Scrimshaw hustled up to the middle deck from the bilges with signs of a bite wound. While he headed above, Mad Harry headed down to the bilges with me and Buster, where we discovered six <a style=\\\"color: black; text-decoration: none;\\\" class=\\\"freeCaptain\\\" href=\\\"http://princessbride.wikia.com/wiki/Rodents_of_unusual_size\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">rodents of unusual size<span class=\\\"tooltip\\\">Though not encountered in the Fire Swamp, oddly...</span></a>. Varnai, Neryce, and Crimson Cogward joined us {at Scourge\'s direction!} and we dispatched the infestation. Mad Harry was bitten several times, but survived to recover his Armor from Grokk. Varnai recovered his crossbow, I handed mine back along with my lantern, but recovered my compass and ring. After the scrum, Neryce persuaded Grokk to give Rosie her fiddle back, which earned her persistent gratitude. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Evening Events:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Conchabar, Rosie, and Varnai perform for the crew. There\'s some dancing. Neryce joins in the entertainment.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>I tried to talk to Badger {the half-elven gal} again, but she didn\'t really seem to care. She said that in her experience, the best thing was to just not care. Disappointing, but I guess that\'s her way of dealing with our situation. I wonder how long she\'s been a pirate... I doubt she\'d tell me if I asked though. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Perhaps tomorrow will bring more insights. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 5</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Fight and a purse won</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Afternoon Activities: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>I tried to make friends with Crimson Cogward with mixed results.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Mad Harry looked for an opportunistic friendly conversation...\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Aisla was our Lookout today in the Crow\'s Nest.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Neryce was today\'s ratcatcher, but visited Ambrose in the galley.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Varnai was in the bilges, accompanied by one of Plugh\'s goons {a lady}.

Mad Harry stood up to the challenge, and traded haymakers with the brute. It became evident that Owlbear was blind in his left eye, which Mad Harry was able to exploit to a degree. Owlbear tried to escape the fight but was pushed back into the ring, where Mad Harry decked him with a third punch. There was a great commotion. Plugh\'s cronies dragged Owlbear back below-decks. Master Scourge lashes random crew members in the crowd to quell the commotion. Mad Harry is congratulated; Neryce has been given a share of Conchabar\'s winnings and Mad Harry\'s other Knuckleduster, which she returned to him. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the fight, we all agreed to try to find out more about the unknown cronies... with limited success. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/06</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Wormwood Day 6</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Rainy and Nasty</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Nothing much happens during the day, it\'s all we can do to keep up with ship\'s tasks in the inclement weather. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the evening, Crimson Cogward approaches Mad Harry for an arm-wrestling match for funsies.

Tensions rose and Master Scourge arrived, to dispense lashes to Varnai and Mad Harry. Sandarra piped up and tried to take Varnai\'s lashes, but only got awarded some of her own.

We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake. The fool took it, and was shocked to discover that the tables had been turned upon him... Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace? Plugh was strung up, still alive but grievously unconscious, from the rigging as an example to the remaining crew. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To: Master and Officers, The Allegiance<br>From: Purser, The Allegiance </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Please find below a review of various matters that might benefit from your input and consideration. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Revised Crew Compliment:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Officers: </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Captain: Varnai Tideweaver</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>First Mate: Ner\\u00ff\\u00e7e Tr\\u00edtonsd\\u00f4tt\\u00ecr</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Gunner, Second Mate: Aisla </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master-at-Arms, Bosun: Mad Harry Bonny</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Navigator, Purser, Chief Engineer: Emalliandra</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Chef: Ambrose Kroop</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Suggested Officer Promotions:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chaplain, Doctor: Sandarra Quinn</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Quartermaster: Conchabar</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Bosun\'s Mate: Rosie</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Gunner\'s Mate: Kipper</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>General Crew {Riggers, Swabs, Bilge-rats}:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chiveeka </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Larry {the Rahadoumi sailor of the vacant, distant stare}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Curly {the Rahadoumi sailor who misses his booze}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Moe {the Rahadoumi sailor who saw her two best friends killed by us and is probably still mad about that...}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Ratline Ratsburger</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps Chumlet</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Maheem </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Narwhal </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Patch Patchsalt </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mascot: Owlbear</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Total Crew Compliment: 19, 20 counting Owlbear or Buster, 21 counting Owlbear and Buster.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Spellcasters aboard able to use Animate Tools: 2 \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Notes on formerly hostile crew members:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps: Bully personality, may harbor a grudge for his fall from favor...

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling.

The box, on investigation, is found to contain a very large amount of narcotics. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The chainmail worn by their captain, Aspar Tharkidor, showed magical emanations, and was seized by Aisla; I acquired a new suit of Masterwork Studded Leather from a fallen Marine and the captain\'s masterwork rapier. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Having obtained Plunder and sufficient crew, I recommended to the Captain that we should make our way to Sangore, as the largest port in close sailing distance.

Making up for the earlier misfire, Aisla expertly nailed the breach, incinerating all but one of the foul creatures.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure... As the twilight deepened, a lone ship\'s bell was heard tolling across the vacant waves... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/14</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Owlbear Injured</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>During the morning, fog is seen to the north, near the horizon, but it is not significant and has no apparent impact on ship\'s operations.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>During the afternoon, the ship is passed by a breaching whale. The crew finds this entertaining.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Below-decks in the afternoon, Owlbear is playing with a crustacean, but he also appears to have been injured somehow. I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Varnai spoke to the crew and roused their spirits, and we proceeded handily with securing the ship for the gale.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The storm hit in the midafternoon, and while the ship rolled in the storm, a ships\' bell tolling from aft is plainly heard.

The Deathknell began to submerge and Mad Harry leapt out onto the harpoon lodged in our hull and sliced at the rope connecting our ships. He clearly hit, but didn\'t cleave the rope; Buster leapt out to finish the job, successfully, and was caught by Harry before he could fall into the waves.  Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake. We will likely take two days to make landfall.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/27</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Troubling developments</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Six more sick Petes today, as well as Ratline, Reef, Fishmouth, and Chiveeka.

Blind Ben responded that he \\\"always felt stronger after eating, but that our true strength is in our bones, and if we can\'t use that strength we should share it.\\\" Varnai\'s face was priceless.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Ten\'n\'one was discovered attempting to break quarantine to visit Fishmouth, and was warned away by Mad Harry.

Sails are indeed visible to the west, and appears to be coming on slightly faster than we can make way. As the last rays of sunlight wane, the ship is identified as a four-masted Chelish Man\'o\'war. We\'ve hoisted the yellow Plague Flag and lit the braziers to clearly illuminate it, but the Chelish ship has clearly turned to overtake us...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/28</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A sheltered cove</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Over the night, our pursuer has gained on us, but we have 6 more sick Petes and the Chelish have gained on us further.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today. Repairs have proceeded well in spite of the weather. The witch-doctor returned today with curative assistance for three of our crew as well as a bangle he tells us to hand in the quarantine area to suck out the illness that remains with the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rain has arrived as forecast, and appears to be getting worse roughly as expected. Neryce tells us that the rain should last through tomorrow evening, and should clear up thereafter. Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.  Neryce, Aisla, and Buster rejoined us, and we continued to glide out of the cove with the tide.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our departure was detected, and despite Neryce\'s conjured mists, several ballista shots landed home on the hull, but Varnai concluded his long-winded transmutation and we were able to slip away without more than a subsequent half-hearted volley from the incapacitated Dominator.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A successful escape</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Two more Petes have recovered today, and no further Petes are reporting signs of the illness.

It was here that I caught up to our group, having finished today\'s negotiations for the sale of our plunder, and discovered the pleasurable company of Captain Merril Pegsworthy. On hearing of our encounter with the Deathknell, he related a similar experience for one of his subordinate ships.

The man is clearly aged, but the timeless age of a properly venerable fellow. He introduced himself as Doren, and requested passage out of Quent, with no destination in mind. I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well. This leaves us with 59 Junior Officers and Crew, one mascot, and one passenger.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section11\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">The Sealed Sarcophagus</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Foggy Day...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The fog today , while not so thick on as the gloaming we encountered around the Deathknell, was still thick enough to masque the approach of a midsize fishing vessel flying no colors off the port bow.

Varnai is having none of this, however, and after righting our course we are in pursuit once more.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the Allegiance closes again, tendrils of fire strafe our sails just before Mad Harry orders the grappling - it seems they have a spellcaster...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/17</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Incedental Retrospective</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The past several days have been odd to say the least.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On capturing the keelboat, which proved to be crewed entirely by spellcasters who fought to the death (taking three of our Petes with them), in a shielded chamber in their hold, we discovered a sealed silver sarcophagus inlaid with intricate runes in deep platinum, radiating highly potent necromancy. After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain. It claimed that the cost would be harmless to the bound bargainer over the long run, but we all decided the offer was not sanguine.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We decided to bury the thing, and disembarked to bury the sarcophagus. The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well. Neryce saved him at the brink of death, as we subdued the beetle, but left it alive and stabilized to hopefully serve as a guardian over the entombed silver sarcophagus.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section12\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">Additional Adventures</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/19</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Returning to Quent</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>With the Keelboat in tandem, we returned briefly to Quent to carouse again and vend our various items of plunder.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

I\'ve advised an easterly course around Motaku Isle, cutting through the large unnamed lagoon south of Dahak\'s Fang and then into the long southwest passage marked on the Chelish charts as \'Cuthroat Run\' - I believe that the Wormwood transited this passage at least in part on our initial journey from Port Peril.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/10/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Kelp Monster!</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>This morning, in the wee hours, our ship was attacked by what I can only describe as a fragrant Kelp Monster. Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time. Periodically, though, it will cease to function until returned to the surface. Aisla dubbed it the \'Helm of Stylish Drowning\' and the name seems to have stuck.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

With the recent \\\"alliance\\\" of the pirates of the Shackles with Sargava it has diminished in relevance as a point of defense for the Shackles. The most recent Free Captain to inhabit the Keep was Bertram Smythee, aka. Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot.

Sails rise from a bluff, gilded platform. Close examination of the ship through the Farglass indicates that this is a vessel of Osiriani design. As the ship closes, we can see thugs in over-embellished armor moving about between buildings on deck, and they have raised a flag of parlay. The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans.

I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me.

While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear.

Owlbear tried to escape the fight but was pushed back into the ring, where Mad Harry decked him with a third punch. There was a great commotion. Plugh\'s cronies dragged Owlbear back below-decks. Master Scourge lashes random crew members in the crowd to quell the commotion.

We found a path leading inland, past a ruined tent smelling of rotting corpses but containing only piles of clothes and rugs. We refrained from further examination at my urging, as I was nervous about our encounter last night with the undead wenches from the Chelish ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Further along the path, we came to the ruins of a bridge which Buster was able to ford with a rope, but at which we also encountered two large frogs which tried to eat us. We dispatched them without being injured and continued along the path to reach an abandoned village with an overgrown safe harbor on the north shore. Aisla went back to the jolly boat to move it to the north shore while the rest of us moved to scale the northeastern promontory. Upon reaching the top, we sighted grindylow at the jolly boat and hustled back down to meet Aisla just past our rope bridge. We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake. The fool took it, and was shocked to discover that the tables had been turned upon him... Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace? Plugh was strung up, still alive but grievously unconscious, from the rigging as an example to the remaining crew. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To: Master and Officers, The Allegiance<br>From: Purser, The Allegiance </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Please find below a review of various matters that might benefit from your input and consideration. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Revised Crew Compliment:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Officers: </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Captain: Varnai Tideweaver</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>First Mate: Ner\\u00ff\\u00e7e Tr\\u00edtonsd\\u00f4tt\\u00ecr</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Gunner, Second Mate: Aisla </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master-at-Arms, Bosun: Mad Harry Bonny</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Navigator, Purser, Chief Engineer: Emalliandra</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Chef: Ambrose Kroop</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Suggested Officer Promotions:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chaplain, Doctor: Sandarra Quinn</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Quartermaster: Conchabar</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Bosun\'s Mate: Rosie</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Gunner\'s Mate: Kipper</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>General Crew {Riggers, Swabs, Bilge-rats}:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chiveeka </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Larry {the Rahadoumi sailor of the vacant, distant stare}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Curly {the Rahadoumi sailor who misses his booze}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Moe {the Rahadoumi sailor who saw her two best friends killed by us and is probably still mad about that...}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Ratline Ratsburger</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps Chumlet</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Maheem </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Narwhal </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Patch Patchsalt </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mascot: Owlbear</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Total Crew Compliment: 19, 20 counting Owlbear or Buster, 21 counting Owlbear and Buster.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Spellcasters aboard able to use Animate Tools: 2 \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Notes on formerly hostile crew members:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps: Bully personality, may harbor a grudge for his fall from favor...

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling. The compartment is revealed to be only just large enough for a person to fit uncomfortably, but it actually contained several heavily laden bags filled with uncut gems and a small wooden box.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure...

I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today.

Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.

I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain.

The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta.

After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably.

As the ship closes, we can see thugs in over-embellished armor moving about between buildings on deck, and they have raised a flag of parlay. The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans.

While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear.

We found a path leading inland, past a ruined tent smelling of rotting corpses but containing only piles of clothes and rugs. We refrained from further examination at my urging, as I was nervous about our encounter last night with the undead wenches from the Chelish ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Further along the path, we came to the ruins of a bridge which Buster was able to ford with a rope, but at which we also encountered two large frogs which tried to eat us. We dispatched them without being injured and continued along the path to reach an abandoned village with an overgrown safe harbor on the north shore. Aisla went back to the jolly boat to move it to the north shore while the rest of us moved to scale the northeastern promontory. Upon reaching the top, we sighted grindylow at the jolly boat and hustled back down to meet Aisla just past our rope bridge. We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake.

Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace?

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive.

While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure...

I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today.

Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.

I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain.

The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta.

After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably.

The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans.

I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me.

While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Still, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Later, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \\\"Mad Harry Bonny\\\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \\\"Mad Harry\\\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>My findings follow...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Group that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>\\\"Ratline\\\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Crimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear.

Owlbear tried to escape the fight but was pushed back into the ring, where Mad Harry decked him with a third punch. There was a great commotion. Plugh\'s cronies dragged Owlbear back below-decks. Master Scourge lashes random crew members in the crowd to quell the commotion.

We found a path leading inland, past a ruined tent smelling of rotting corpses but containing only piles of clothes and rugs. We refrained from further examination at my urging, as I was nervous about our encounter last night with the undead wenches from the Chelish ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Further along the path, we came to the ruins of a bridge which Buster was able to ford with a rope, but at which we also encountered two large frogs which tried to eat us. We dispatched them without being injured and continued along the path to reach an abandoned village with an overgrown safe harbor on the north shore. Aisla went back to the jolly boat to move it to the north shore while the rest of us moved to scale the northeastern promontory. Upon reaching the top, we sighted grindylow at the jolly boat and hustled back down to meet Aisla just past our rope bridge. We rushed the beach and managed to capture them. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai engaged in diplomacy, and in a convoluted exchange, agreed to be conducted to the Grindylow cave near the wreck of the Infernus... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Grindylow Cave</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We entered the cave on the southwest side of the island, and were ambushed by six grindylows and an armored, helmeted leader who we believe is the Son of Grindylow. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the assault, we backtracked into a narrower side passage, whih curves around the watery cavern and gives easier access to the path further into the Grindylow cave. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/07/30</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Shipwrecked Day 2</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Victory Part 1</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We crossed the Devilfish pool, and proceed to the west up the incline. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>When we crested the rise, we were at a cauldron-shaped room, containing Kipper, Conchabar, and Sandarra tied upon the wall and Mama Grindylow next to them, apparently by suction. Upon our appearance, she screeched in Aquan {I think she said \\\"feast on these morsels\\\" or somesuch?} and dropped her hostages into the murky lagoon. Varnai and Neryce sprinted forward and buoyed them up. Mad Harry bolted our potion of Haste and was fed an Enlarge Person draught by Aisla, and lumbered forward as well. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mama G Entangled them all and dropped to the water, to be pounced viciously by Buster and bombed by Aisla. The Whale, a massive Grindylow-thing, surfaced and grabbed Buster in its mouth, presumably in response to its Queens command. Mad Harry assaulted it while it swallowed Buster, and Mama G drank down a healing potion and submerged. Mad Harry was all fired up, dealing terrible blows to the giant Grindymonster, while Varnai and Neryce freed our friends. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I think I might have overheard Varnai and Sandarra flirting in the midst of combat, but perhaps it was my imagination - I was somewhat distracted by an advancing wall of barricade flotsam propelled by more of the Grindyclan. Whatever they said, Sandarra cursed the creature that had consumed Buster before Mad Harry rent it asunder. Buster mauled his way out of its gullet, and while Neryce submerged briefly, Conchabar worked some magic of his own. Varnai led the group back to the exit while I, invisibly adroit, greased the incline to thwart the Grindywall and render them more vulnerable to Aisla\'s bombing. As our crew extricated themselves from the water, Sandarra called upon her faith and a surge of healing energy swept over us. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Renewed, and having handily routed the erstwhile rearguard, we regrouped to learn that the Grindyqueen had released a Lacedon to assail us and might yet hold another in reserve. Neryce bestowed Mad Harry with an aquatic nature and he descended into the depths and slew the Queen and her undead minion. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our rescue of Kipper has led to an unsurprising revelation: Plugh plans to kill us all when we return to the Man\'s Promise.

By which, of course, I mean that when Scourge conducted us into the Captain\'s cabin, we were all ready for a fight. Buster was in full fighting form, Aisla was bouncy, Neryce and Mad Harry were both slightly on edge, and I was feeling pretty nervous. Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake. The fool took it, and was shocked to discover that the tables had been turned upon him... Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>It was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace? Plugh was strung up, still alive but grievously unconscious, from the rigging as an example to the remaining crew. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To: Master and Officers, The Allegiance<br>From: Purser, The Allegiance </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Please find below a review of various matters that might benefit from your input and consideration. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Revised Crew Compliment:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Officers: </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Captain: Varnai Tideweaver</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>First Mate: Ner\\u00ff\\u00e7e Tr\\u00edtonsd\\u00f4tt\\u00ecr</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Gunner, Second Mate: Aisla </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master-at-Arms, Bosun: Mad Harry Bonny</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Navigator, Purser, Chief Engineer: Emalliandra</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Master Chef: Ambrose Kroop</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Suggested Officer Promotions:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chaplain, Doctor: Sandarra Quinn</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Quartermaster: Conchabar</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Bosun\'s Mate: Rosie</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Gunner\'s Mate: Kipper</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>General Crew {Riggers, Swabs, Bilge-rats}:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Chiveeka </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Larry {the Rahadoumi sailor of the vacant, distant stare}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Curly {the Rahadoumi sailor who misses his booze}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Moe {the Rahadoumi sailor who saw her two best friends killed by us and is probably still mad about that...}</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Ratline Ratsburger</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps Chumlet</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Maheem </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Narwhal </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Patch Patchsalt </li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Mascot: Owlbear</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Total Crew Compliment: 19, 20 counting Owlbear or Buster, 21 counting Owlbear and Buster.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>Spellcasters aboard able to use Animate Tools: 2 \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul>Notes on formerly hostile crew members:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Fipps: Bully personality, may harbor a grudge for his fall from favor...

Valuing our Plunder at roughly that level, I proposed such an exchange. With  Captain Varnai\'s consent, I also contracted for the installation of two smuggling compartments and a wider rudder to facilitate easier handling, paying for these modifications out of our personally accumulated wealth. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We\'re properly pirates now, I suppose... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/03</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Water Naga Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Aisla has been cooped up with her alchemical concoctions for over 24 hours now, and if I knew anything of her art, I would venture to disturb her creativity to check on her, but I dare not disrupt her in my uneducated state... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the middle of the second day of our refit, several locals invited Rosie and Conchabar to participate in a game of nine-pin on the docks. Rosie invited us as well. The locals moved to hoist up a keg of beer from the river, when the keg was ripped from them by an unknown force from beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai leapt in to rescue the man who had been hoisting the beer, and was able to extricate Jenkins, but was then bitten for his trouble by a Water Naga youth. Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga. Varnai, heavily injured by the bite, withdrew from the fray while Rosie joined in and Conchabar strummed a rousing tune. Mad Harry sliced at the enraged monster again, while Neryce\'s summoned squid assaulted the creature from beneath the waves. I fired again, and hit, and Buster leapt forward to land a bite on the monster. Varnai conjured a snowball, but missed; the Naga, still agitated, invoked the magics of its species to become invisible, and vanished beneath the waves. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake arrived after the commotion had died down accompanied by Chandra, his druidic associate. I noticed that Neryce and Chandra exchanged remarks in a language I\'ve never heard before... Chandra explained that this kind of attack was somewhat atypical for the local Naga, which matched what I have read and heard of the species. Chandra indicated that she had, on behalf of Master Hake, negotiated a peace with the Water Naga living upstream... I explained that the creature had appeared to be a youth and perhaps also unhinged. Chandra indicated that it was a real possibility that the muddy condition of the river and the drought could have driven the creature past the bend... She indicated that she would travel upstream to speak with the Naga. She indicated that my offer to accompany her was inadvisable at present, but seemed open to the idea of a potential future visit... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Sandarra arrived at this point and healed our wounds, while Master Hake indicated he would give us a 250gp discount on our squibbing... </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/04</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Wasps Attack</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our third day at Rickety\'s Squibs dawns even hotter than the past two, with no possibility of rain in sight... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the afternoon, while discussing the matter of the renaming of the ship, we begin to hearing shouts of alarm from the outside. We discover that the docks and town appear to be under attack from a swarm of roughly two dozen giant wasps. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were able to save another dock worker, and were able to down four wasps. Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Rickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Only a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Master Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting. He was survived by his parrot, Rotgut, who now appears to have decided to adopt Mad Harry.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On our return, Captain Pegsworthy has hoisted over a cask of Chelish spirits for consumption, and invites us to test its contents for potability. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/05</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Hour of Departure</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the morning, I awoke to news that the Allegiance was nearing completion, and accompanied the messenger back to examine the results. Having found the changes highly satisfactory, we attended Captain Pegsworthy\'s christening of the Allegiance, and put out to sea. Moe elected to remain behind at the Squibs to replace the watchman, Lyle Goodwin, so our crew is even more reduced, and I suspect we will be unable to enjoy the full measure of the ship\'s performance until our numbers are expanded. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Location of Note: Tidewater Rock - South of Botakku Rock, this castle commands an excellent position for defense as well as a base to assault shipping lanes. It is often used in toasts for good fortune. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we sail away, morale is high and the crew is in good spirits, and clearly have gained a bit of respect for us, even the more questionable members. Our next task is to determine what target or targets to raid in order to obtain plunder. Plunder will be integral to our ability to attract new crew members, but we\'ll be very limited in our ability to pillage anything due to our diminished crew compliment... Ambrose suggested a raid on a small fishing village, which was met with less than entirely rousing enthusiasm by the Captain. I suggested that perhaps we could assault a ship to take its cargo alone, and leave its crew alive, the better to spread tales of our infamy... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Personal Log:I hope we can find a merchant of less savory character for our raid, one whose chattel are undeservedly possessed... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I never thought to become a pirate, but it seems that I am one now, and with companions of surprising compatibility and complimentary skill. There is much in this way of life for a kind and good soul to question and challenge. Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state. Also, while I recognize that any path must be shaped in part by others, I feel I must pursue redress for the grievance of being forced by circumstance and contrivance to kill those I might otherwise have not. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Syl, Plugh and Scourge deserved death, as might others still from the Wormwood, but the Rahadoumi soldiers and the officer we cut down all died because we chose to sacrifice their lives instead of our own. I chose to save my life by taking hers... I can only hope that the choices that brought her to that moment were her own, for then at least one of us would have been acting freely. I advanced down a path that was not of my own choosing... We all did, and for that, Harrigan must pay. Now that I have regained my freedom, I choose this path freely that was until of late forced upon me, with a clear conscience and a purposeful mind. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/07</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Local Recruitment</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Spending the previous day finding the village that Ambrose recalled on Firegrass Isle, we decided to weigh anchor and sail in this morning to start our recruitment drive. We anchored in the harborage; Sandarra, Rosie, and Conchabar accompanied us in one of the gigs to the shore. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We were met by a large contingent of spearmen at the dock, but they allowed us to land and did not obstruct our recruitment. While many of their youths seemed to be interested, they were shepherded away by adult members. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>At sunset, having pursued a fairly boring day all told, we rowed back to the ship. We were followed by a small fishing boat to the ship, carrying two people, a young woman {~18 or 19} and an even younger boy {aged ~14}. They introcuce themselves as Opal and Reef. Opal is nearly 6\' and well muscled especially for a woman; Reef is a highly scrawny, small lad. Their parents are dead, they told us, and there is nothing keeping them in Goatshead. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p> Captain Varnai welcomed them aboard, and we resolved to get underway towards Chelish shipping lanes in the morning. </p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/08/18</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Stalking Prey...</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal </span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Once we get into open waters by the second day, the seas are calm and nothing much happens.

The Allegiance has also acquired the two siege weapons carried by the Kurstav, a light catapult and a light ballista. We also acquired two Chain-shot payloads, as well as miscellaneous Aspis Consortium paperwork of no apparent value. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Under the Captain\'s cabin, Harry located a secret compartment. Opening it, we discovered that it had been trapped, firing two darts at Harry. One hit him, the other missed rotgut and embeds itself in the ceiling.

Her account indicated that the fishy fellow clambered up on deck and tried to drag Pete into the sea, but that she was able to stop the creature with her axe. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Recording specifically which Pete was attacked for posterity is ... problematic. Several days ago, Aisla started a trend, which appears to have caught on with the crew entirely, of referring to any of the crew whose names fail to come to mind as \\\"Pete\\\" ... Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \\\"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\\\" ... </p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<strong style=\\\"font-size: larger;\\\">Deep Platinum</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<br>This rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \\\"black smokers.\\\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p></blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness. I also think that, as Bosun\'s Mate, Rosie might be invited to provide input regarding improvements for the ship that the necklace might fund.

A Chelish cutter was locked in combat with a burning brig, and prisoners were being led below deck by Chelish marines on the burning ship. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver ordered course changes to bring us into the fray from the east, as though out of the rising sun. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Famished Main, out of Corentyn {the Chelish outpost at the northern end of the Arch of Aroden}, was clearly overpowering the brig, named the Vorsfang, probably a local ship from the Shackles. The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Combat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \\\"would do anything to recover.\\\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Captain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>To deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Of note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \\\"improved potency\\\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts. </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water. It crosses the reflection of the setting sun, and as the sun slips beyond the horizon, it\'s suddenly nowhere to be seen... </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I expressed concerns, possibly fueled by my exhaustion, that the ship sighted might have submersible properties, as I seemed to recall reading accounts of submarine vessels of gnomish fabrication in the Great Library in Absalom. Better than than a ghost ship, to be sure...

I gently enquired; Owlbear pantomimed what seemed to be an attack, but I\'m not really sure. Sandarra confirmed that this appears to have been the result of an intentional strike with a plank of wood. After Sandarra healed his wound, I left Buster in his hedgehog form with Owlbear with instructions to watch over him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While finishing dinner, Buster reported that some crew are harassing Owlbear. I commanded Buster to contain the situation and advise the crew to stop and wait for our arrival. We covered the distance to the lower deck swiftly and found Fishmouth and three Petes waiting for us. Fishmouth, when challenged, tried to sidestep the issue. Buster recounted an encounter where the crew ganged up on Owlbear, intimidating him and pelting him with fruit. Captain Tideweaver rebuked Fishmouth, who spoke for the group, and promised it wouldn\'t happen again. When I challenged Fishmouth on the matter, he reluctantly admitted to injuring Owlbear earlier with a plank as well. Varnai left their punishment to Mad Harry, who elected to drub them soundly with their weapons of choice. I left Buster to continue to play with Owlbear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Harry and Fishmouth move topside to brawl. Fishmouth got a quick hit in at the start of the fight, but was quickly dispatched thereafter. Ten\'n\'one appeared abruptly, brimming with oily apologies for his friend, and offered additional apologies and a healing potion heavily laced with rum to our moderately wounded Bosun. He dragooned two Petes to help him carry his portly comrade below-decks.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/15</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">A Storm Rolls In</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A quiet pall subsumes the ship today, shrouding all with a cloak of unease.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Joining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Our return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Ambrose indicates that two options present themselves: attacking an entrenched enemy or setting fire to the ship and waiting...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Varnai offered an opportunity to parlay. Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Buster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>We have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \\\"Deathknell\\\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Reacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:</p>\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/20</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The Deathknell Encountered</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks. After clawing spectrally at Buster unsuccessfully and being swiped for his trouble, while the crew of the Allegiance polished off more zombies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>After his lack of success with Buster, the Captain of the whaler turned his attention to me. He was, it seems, was a breath-stealer, who nearly made me his thrall. After stealing my breath and being mauled again by Buster, as my comrades fought on against the zombies, I lost consciousness. I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains. We evacuated to the Allegiance just as the lines connecting the ships were starting to unbalance our ship. Harry, Neryce, and I cut them off and scaled the hull to return to find that nary a Pete had been lost in the fray.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"section9\\\"><h1 class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">A Plague of Problems</h1>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/25</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">The start of our troubles</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Neryce has been training Rotgut, with a degree of success.

Mad Harry has reported similar findings. Varnai addressed the crew to alleviate their concerns, though I\'m not sure how much it was necessary. Mad Harry discovered that Ten\'n\'One was the source of the majority of the unrest. Mad Harry spoke with him on the subject, and he was typically obsequious in his response. Buster has agreed to cautiously shadow the shifty halfling going forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Consultation with Ambrose, Onyx, and Sandarra has yielded limited leads on regional relief, but Ambrose suggested trying to locate a small settlement with a healer whose help we could request. Sandarra, on consultation, also requests that Conchabar, who has fallen ill along with another Pete, be made to be quiet. Rosie, who had been unobtrusively observing, promised to deal with the Gnome. Based on our findings, my official recommendation to Varnai was to make for the larger island in the near chain southwest of Motaku Isle, on the basis that it has a notably large inland lake.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not. All of the Petes are still ill...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Approaching the island, we can see a clear entry to a sheltered cove, there are several native riggers about, they either give us a wide berth or proceed towards the village at high speed. As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \\\"aid\\\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours. Neryce\'s forecast suggests that tomorrow night, during the oncoming rainstorm, will be our best chance to escape.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"entry\\\">\\n\\t\\t<h2 class=\\\"clickableJournalTitle\\\"><span class=\\\"gameDate\\\">4714/09/29</span><span class=\\\"journalContext\\\">Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance</span> - <span class=\\\"journalTitleText\\\">Hatching a plan</span><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\"> - Emalliandra: Adventure Journal</span></h2>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"body\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While the Allegiance has been at anchor, it\'s been much easier to ensure minimal exposure to our quarantined crew, and we have no additional ill crew today.

Leaving tonight is clearly indicated, and Varnai gives orders to prepare for our departure once visibility to the Dominator becomes impaired.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The downpour is torrential by sunset, as we finilize preparations to depart. Aisla and Neryce set off to sabotage the Dominator, accompanied by Buster in the form of an unfettered Octupus. On arrival, the trio discovered that the rudder control ropes were housed within the hull, but happily Neryce\'s <i>warp wood</i> twisted the rudder hinge housing sufficiently to permit Buster to squeeze in and bite through the rope. On signaling back to the Allegiance, Varnai ordered the rudder dropped and started casting <i>alter winds</i> to aid our flight.

I suspected at once that he was connected in some way to the Hurricain King, and suggested that we not press him for fare. After tasking Pete to show our elderly guest to a cabin, we discovered two Petes missing. Rumors from the crew suggested that they both wanted to stay behind in Quent. Varnai took a few hours to track them down to confirm this, and it turned out that they each had relatives in the city and indeed wanted to stay behind, which Varnai happily accepted. On returning to the ship, Varnai spoke to the crew on the subject of voluntary participation, and Pete elected to avail himself of the chance to go ashore as well.

After two days of cautious scrutiny on our way back to Quent, I concluded that touching the coffer would not be ruinously hazardous and might provide additional answers, as we were unable to find any other source for the keelboat\'s heightened speed and maneuverability. Instead, all I have now are more questions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The block of silver (we discovered that the casing was merely designed to look like a sarcophagus) is apparently occupied by an entity claiming to be able to offer a soul-binding bargain.

The bulk of the work went smoothly, but our party was attacked by a giant beetle. The beetle\'s charge slew Buster outright, and nearly killed Mad Harry as well.

This modification seems to have gone very well - he\'s now able to use the harpoon as a conduit for his electrical attacks. Mad Harry seemed taken with the enchanted falcatta we liberated from the inimitable Captain Svard, and I was able to acquire a well-made kukri to enchant for him, so as to leave him with a well-matched set of blades. If Svard had a name for his weapon, it went to the depths with him, and Harry has taken to calling his new toys \'Falcon\' and \'Cucco\' ...

Neryce identified it as a Sargassum Fiend, but Kelp Monster sums it up nicely. It killed two Petes and nearly slew Rosie before we managed to subdue it. The crewman we now call \'Bomber Harry\' has been appropriated by Aisla for her artillery squad after ingeniously lighting up the creature with one of the ship\'s lanterns, or so I\'m told. I was late to the fight. Remembering the proper conjugation for an imperative command in infernal to \'assist the people on deck in attacking the kelp monster\', as well as the proper way to say \'kelp monster\' in that diabolical tongue, right out of a deep, peaceful sleep, is not the easiest of things to manage. Not that I really intended to summon the Hell Hound, it just sort of happened while I was still waking up. As I arrived, Aisla had just lofted a bomb at the creature. Imagine my surprise when, instead of detonating on impact, the charge\'s outer coating fractured as it slipped deeper within the tangled mass of seaweed and then detonated heavily. Based on Neryce\'s autopsy afterwords, I think its fair to say that the bomb carried the fight...</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>While she was unable to extract some pheremonal glands she wanted, we did discover a magical helmet that grants the ability to breathe water ... most of the time.

None of my charts denote a settlement as existing here, and I prevailed on the Captain to permit us to investigate. The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \\\"The Fish Man\\\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>As we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching. It seems that a giant crab, on the scale of the beetle that attacked us while burying the sarcophagus, has taken up residence in the remains of the Corking Gull.

Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot. Master Vaashammyr indicates that the lady was reasonably well known to him before his shipwreck, and expressed a desire to perhaps visit the stronghold.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on our course, a correction to the east should bring us to the Rock by midafternoon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h3>Later that afternoon...</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">page 33, top-right</span>A tower rises like a solid block from the sea at the edge of the Windward Isle. The pounding surf rolls around its base and partially covers the steps that lead up to its front gate. A few arrow slits pierce its walls here and there, and a single shuttered window opens high upon the face of the fortress. A roof of metal shingles rises from its battlements where sentries keep lookout and siege weapons stand ready on corner turrets.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On arriving, the Lady Agasta Smythee challenged our approach from the battlements, but was persuaded by William to meet us. We were met by her major domo, Roister McCleigh, who requested that we volunteer a hostage to be held against our good behavior and well-intentions. Neryce volunteered, and was conducted to her captivity, after which we were permitted to join the Lady Agasta for dinner and conversation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>The heavy iron chandelier over the long oaken table in the solar at the top of the keep was already lit when we arrived and were greeted by the striking Lady Agasta. After some catching up with William about his father (who William clearly believes to be dead), Varnai manages to steer the conversation to the subject of our blood vendetta against Harrigan.</p><span class=\\\"ooc-data\\\">Infamy: 10 | Disrepute: 10</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Lady Agasta was unwilling to merely enter an alliance, but proposed a political marriage to Captain Varnai for a period of one year, during which time co-comittent use of the spouse\'s property is unrestricted. After that year, the marriage can be dissolved in divorce at the discretion of either party amicably. If the arrangement ends in divorce, it is expected that both parties will return the other\'s properties and part amicably.

Sails rise from a bluff, gilded platform. Close examination of the ship through the Farglass indicates that this is a vessel of Osiriani design. As the ship closes, we can see thugs in over-embellished armor moving about between buildings on deck, and they have raised a flag of parlay. The ship is called the Jeweled Bird, and is not </p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>A Guards-master bellows a greeting and charges us to permit him to conduct us to his boss, Master Lacuni, to assist him in an issue of navigation, as the crew of a Ship of the Shackles. After a moment of consideration, Varnai agreed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Guards-master Jeg conducted us below-deck to a thoroughly decadent harem chamber, where Master Lacuni greeted us jovially and enjoined us to accompany us to his office. His lackeys conducted him in a palanquin; we followed in silence. Guards-master Jeg appears to be a long-suffering man.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In Lacuni\'s office, after we were all seated, he sent a guard to fetch the \\\"purple and blue\\\" and then spent ten minutes basking in his own existence. Once the guard returned with a large cage full of purple and blue exotic birds, which piqued Neryce\'s interest, Lacuni explained that as a Merchant King, he was investigating the opening of new trade routes to the Shackles and was in need of navigational assistance to Port Peril and the court of the Hurricane King.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>On being asked his purpose, he offered to show us his merchandise, something that clearly puffed up his ego every time he had the opportunity. We were conducted through a nursery full of plants both mundane and exotic, some of which appeared to be very interested in our progress. (Neryce identified several as being poisonous or otherwise high-risk.) Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance. The most vile display, though, was when his guards were called to restrain the [] for Lacuni to pet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>I could take no more, and in my role as both naviagtrix and purser, I advised Lacuni as helpfully as I could that in actuality, Port Peril though large was often frequented by less than reputable folk and saw very little of the Hurricane King. I suggested that he would be better served by heading to Tidewater Rock, the Hurricane King\'s nearby fortress. After some minor questions, Lacuni agreed and summoned his navigator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>Alphonse, the navigator, is a local man who explained that his charts had been charred and burnt in an accident with one of the creatures when it had gotten loose, and recognized that Tidewater Rock had not seen the presence of a Hurricane King in quite some time - I agreed, and explained that Varnai was the lord of Tidewater Rock and that we had every intention of disrupting Lacuni\'s operations permanently. Alphonse warned me that Lacuni was clever in his own way and that is seemed that he must have \\\"bought \'stupid\' just because it was for sale\\\" ... In the end, Alphonse wound up copying my charts and backing away slowly having advised me in no uncertain terms that he wanted to stay uninvolved and that he\'d be on the side of whoever won in our conflict. He did confirm that he had no intentions of notifying Lacuni about our plans.

All of my friends think me mad, I fear, and supposedly it\'s bad luck to start a voyage like mine without someone to see you off. I had thought to at least see Dabrent on the quay to try to talk me out of going, but it seems even he has given up. I would have been quite alone had Father not insisted that he and Mother accompany me. The ship is fascinating, though, and as my home now dwindles towards the horizon I have no regrets in my decision. Regrets about lacking the funds to secure faster passage aplenty, but no qualms about my plan.\r\n\r\n\"Go to Ilizmagorti, locate some unexplored ruins in the region, join or start an expedition to them, document my findings, and join the Pathfinders.\" Hm, now that I write it out like that, it does seem a touch ... grandiose. Then again, the letter from Master Devers seemed to indicate that, in addition to providing the location of several ruins, he might be able to point me in the right direction for an expedition. Tatadi said I was being too trusting. We\'ll see if she was right, I suppose.','2015-03-27 16:30:08','2015-03-25 16:20:34'),(4,1,'An abrupt turn of events...','','Emma',1,'4714/06/22','I thought I would be meeting Devers in Ilizmagorti, but his note, left three days ago at the Red Casque, said he\'d had to leave with his ship for Port Peril. Hopefully, the Jenivere will put in there long enough for me to catch him up. I\'m now apparently supposed to be meeting him at the Formidably Maid saloon? If he\'s not there, I\'ll have to look elsewhere for assistance - I haven\'t the funds to keep chasing him down the coast...','2015-03-27 16:31:17','2015-03-27 16:31:54'),(5,1,'Assault for breakfast',', peppered with bravado','Wormwood Day 3',2,'4714/07/03','I\'ve finally managed to scrounge some paper to keep a proper record of my fate... While waiting at the Formidably Maid for Master Devers\' arrival, to provide more details regarding the local cyclopean ruins, I was probably drugged while enjoying some of the Maid\'s ale and press-ganged into service on a pirate ship, the Wormwood, under the command of a truly terrifying man, Captain Harrigan. Some of the crew seem nice enough, while others are markedly not... This morning, a group of hostile crew ganged up on myself and the other new members of the crew.\r\n\r\nI think that people could have gotten hurt if Buster hadn\'t transformed to his combat form. He so unnerved the thugs that assailed us that they all ran away. ... Perhaps Varnai\'s charged personality had something to do with it as well, I\'m sure that the fat one was ... shocked at the outcome of their brief fracas. Master Scourge, the Bosun, seemed none too pleased at the revelation of Buster\'s true form, and I fear I earned his ire for myself when I explained that Buster protected me and obeyed my commands, but at least nobody was seriously injured.\r\n\r\nIt\'s the third day of my forced servitude, and I had the unenviable joy of assisting Ambrose in butchering a hog to celebrate an officer\'s birthday. Ambrose Kroop is the ship\'s cook, and is as often to be found in a drunken stupor as not, so I\'ve had to manage the galley myself until today...\r\n\r\nStill, I seem to have drawn a better lot in my assignment than some of the other new crew. The charming half-elf I met on the Veritance traveling to Ilizmagorti, Varnai Tideweaver, is among the other press-ganged crew. I admit to relief at knowing someone else aboard, despite wishing that he had escaped this fate, though he tells me that the work he\'s doing here on the Wormwood is much the same as his duties were on the Veritance. I can\'t tell if his nonchalance is an affectation or genuine, but it\'s reassuring all the same. Not that Ambrose is bad company {when he\'s sober}. He introduced me to Grokk, the ship\'s Quartermaster, and the three of us chatted for some time while the pork was roasting. Grokk seems to embrace the half-orcish reputation, but she seems decent enough in spite of that.\r\n\r\nLater, I compared the events of the day with the four other newest additions to the crew of the Wormwood. Neryce, a strikingly pretty woman, pointed out and related a friendly discourse she had with Rosie, a burly halfling lass, while swabbing the deck. The man calling himself \"Mad Harry Bonny\", who allegedly asked to join the crew in the midst of the fistfight intended to subdue him for press-ganging, stank of the bilges when he finally emerged above-decks. Varnai was also swabbing the deck with Neryce, but, evidenced by his display this morning, is also a spellcaster and took the time to seek out the ship\'s Sorceress, Peppry Longfarthing. He didn\'t say exactly what came of their conversation, though, and I don\'t think I\'ll be volunteering any more information about my own abilities... Aisla, the fourth new crew member, was in the rigging most of the day today, and went to sleep almost directly after dinner, as did \"Mad Harry\". Neryce and Rosie were apparently propositioned by Conchabar, the rather flamboyantly attired gnome on board. After dinner, Varnai seemed to be having a very good time chatting with Sandarra Quinn. Sandarra is quite possibly the nicest person I\'ve ever met {Tatadi didn\'t even come to see me off!}, which is not quite what I would have expected from an ordained cleric of Besmarra.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I quietly tried to find out everything I could about the crew of the Wormwood, as there is clearly more going on here than meets the eye on casual inspection.\r\n\r\nMy findings follow...\r\n\r\nGroup that assaulted us are Mr. Plugh\'s bootlickers, and are likely to try something again in the future; led by the disgusting human, Fipps Chumlet. {M Dwarf, M hOrc, 2xM Human, 2xF Human}. \r\n\"Ratline\" Ratsburger {M Halfling} is not fully with this group but has been leaning in that direction {after he was decked by Mad Harry for his pocket change last night}. \r\nCrimson Cogward is a loner, boastful braggart who will bend anyone\'s ear. He beat the snot out of Mad Harry last night. \r\nGiffer Tibs {One eyed F Halfling}, friendlyish with Rosie and Conchabar. Olderish, largely indifferent. \r\n\"Badger\" Medlar {F Half-elf}, probably oldest person on the boat, has gray hair shaved into stripes. She\'s been talking tonight with Chiveeka {F Mwangi}, a middle-aged woman with an indifferent attitude. \r\nThe poor simpleton chained up belowdecks is Owlbear, and is kept on board as Mr Plugh\'s \"pet.\" Mr. Plugh is our ... esteemed ... first officer. He gives me the creeps even worse than Master Scourge. \r\nI got a reaction to being the Cook\'s Mate more than once: The Last Cook\'s Mate disappeared suddenly and is speculated to have \"fed the crew\" in a more literal sense...

I managed to get my compass, lantern, and signet ring back from Grokk.\r\nNeryce Mends things... Another spellcaster! \"Barefoot\" Samms Toppin is the first crew member to ask for a personal object to be mended. Neryce also tried to get some of her stuff from Grokk, successfully, I think.\r\nVarnai worked in the rigging today and chatted with Conchabar. Mad Harry was today\'s Ratcatcher with young Jack Scrimshaw. \r\n            \r\nIn the late morning, Jack Scrimshaw hustled up to the middle deck from the bilges with signs of a bite wound.

Varnai, Neryce, and Crimson Cogward joined us {at Scourge\'s direction!} and we dispatched the infestation. Mad Harry was bitten several times, but survived to recover his Armor from Grokk. Varnai recovered his crossbow, I handed mine back along with my lantern, but recovered my compass and ring. After the scrum, Neryce persuaded Grokk to give Rosie her fiddle back, which earned her persistent gratitude.\r\n\r\nEvening Events:\r\nConchabar, Rosie, and Varnai perform for the crew. There\'s some dancing. Neryce joins in the entertainment.\r\nI tried to talk to Badger {the half-elven gal} again, but she didn\'t really seem to care. She said that in her experience, the best thing was to just not care. Disappointing, but I guess that\'s her way of dealing with our situation. I wonder how long she\'s been a pirate...

Varnai, though, was as cool as an electric cucumber, having charged his <em>Shocking Grasp</em> before entering the cabin.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to hear Plugh congratulate us and offer kind words, but Varnai must have caught something I missed because he extended his charged hand for Plugh to shake.

Scourge bellowed for the cronies, who were apparently waiting just outside in ambush, and combat was properly joined.\r\n\r\nIt was a proper brawl, and I can\'t recall it properly. Once Plugh and Scourge were down, someone offered amnesty for cronies who would lay down their arms. I can\'t recall who said it, but Maheem was the only one to act on the offer. It may be worth noting in his favor that he didn\'t just stop fighting, he actively joined our side and tried to subdue Syl. Unsuccessfully, as it developed - Syl died in the fight {and good riddance}. Scourge\'s last act, as I recall, was to sneer, unless that was supposed to be a grimace?

Acting erratically, the Naga roiled the muddy waters while Mad Harry leapt into the fray. Neryce started a summoning incantation while I loosed a crossbow bolt... Buster finished his transformation and repositioned himself for a charge at the Naga.

Two more were downed by other combatants; five residents are dead or were carried off by the wasps. Many more of the villagers were injured by the wasps, however, but the aftermath of the attack was not nearly as bad as might have been expected.\r\n\r\nRickety Hake, having been further inland at his residence, arrives on the scene after the fight is over. He curses the drought, curses the absence, however necessary, of his Druid, and curses roundly at the delay to his enterprise.\r\n\r\nI dispatched Buster to pursue the wasps against a potential opportunity to rescue any of those people carried away...\r\n\r\nOnly a few minutes after the flight of the wasps, a Chelish galleon weighed anchor in the harbor, and a longboat with nine men drew up at the dock. Eight bodyguards and a peg-legged man {Captain Merril Pegsworthy, as we shortly discovered} emerged from the longboat and assumed a defensive {but not explicitly threatening} posture.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pegsworthy expressed interest in a squibbing, and seemed reasonably content to hear that he\'ll have to wait another day or two. He\'s clearly no friend to our former Captain Harrigan, and upon learning of our exploits in obtaining our current ship, asked after the privilege of christening our squibbed vessel. The honor of having our ship christened by a Free Captain is exceptional, and I\'m glad that  Captain Varnai was so willing to accept.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pegsworthy is wearing an Andoran Eagle Knight\'s uniform jacket, that while somewhat worn and well used, is clearly a favored garment. He appears impressed by the Captain\'s retelling of our daring deeds...\r\n\r\nMaster Hake approaches and, after listening to the end of the tale, asks if we could investigate his watchman\'s lack of response atop the watchtower. After having Buster drive off two wild boar on the trail, we found Lyle Goodwin, the watchman, dead atop the tower from a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting.

Much benefit of goodness could be had here, I think, if only based upon the reactions of the crew to the fairer terms offered by Captain Tideweaver. I know not if I possess the courage and strength of character to be such a soul, nor if our circumstances will allow it, but I cannot turn from the path I have found. I must stay the course, no matter the risk, for I now have companionship and friends where before my life was solitary and a poor comparison to my present state.

Nobody seems to mind, and somehow there hasn\'t been any real confusion as to which Pete is meant in any given context - certainly I know which Pete Rosie was talking about. I wonder if other pirate crews experience this phenomenon. The Wormwood seemed not to, but I\'m not so sure that it was ever a representative sample of what passes for normal around here...\r\n\r\nThe creature was wearing the shiny iridescent necklace that Buster reported seeing in the fray with the trawler, which Captain Tideweaver awarded to Rosie for her intrepid feat. Ten\'n\'one crept up at this point and tentatively identified the necklace as Deep Platinum, and worth enough to buy a small house. This information tickled a memory for me,and I was able to recall reading of the existence of Deep Platinum... This was sufficient grounds for Varnai to find Rosie again and speak with her about its value. She seemed disappointed to have her reward rescinded, but accepted it with good enough grace.\r\n\r\nAfter Varnai recovered the necklace from Rosie, I was able to study the necklace more thoroughly and identified it positively as Deep Platinum. I recall having read the following, excerpted from \"Travels and Exploits of Marcus Konstrachus, Volume 14, Annotated Revised Edition\" ...<blockquote><strong style=\"font-size: larger;\">Deep Platinum</strong>\r\nThis rare platinum alloy is characterized by blue-black whorls of an almost disturbing aspect, and is virtually unknown to those living above the surface of the sea. It is actually mined from platinum deposits in the deepest ocean trenches, where it is tainted by exposure to poisonous deep sea vents called \"black smokers.\" Only aboleths, krakens, or other creatures of the ocean depths can recover this metal from these fathomless trenches. On land, deep platinum has the same value as normal platinum, but it is of inestimable value to undersea races such as the sahuagin, who often ascribe religious or magical qualities to the rare metal.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBased on this, and the weight of the necklace, I estimate it to be worth roughly 2,000 gold measures to land-dwelling folk, but I have no way to tell how valuable it might be to the races of the deeps, nor do I presently have any desire to try to find out.\r\n\r\nIn place of the necklace, Neryce offered to transmute Rosie\'s trusty axe into masterworkedness.

The superstructure of the Vorsfang had not yet thoroughly caught fire by the time our approach was spotted, but its sails were a lost cause. The Famished Main loosed several ballista shots to no avail, but appeared to have lacked sufficient time to mount a proper defense.\r\n\r\nCombat was swiftly joined against the handful of Chelish Marines and the ship\'s captain. Quickly seizing control of the situation through magic and skill, Varnai accepted the surrender of Siventris Tiserond, Master of the Famished Main.This left us with 25 Chelish crew, plus Captain Tiserond, and 14 pirates, former prisoners, from the Vorsfang.\r\n\r\nThe Vorsfang itself was fully ablaze by the time we were fully in control of the situation, but Varnai and Neryce were able to keep the fires from spreading to the cutter easily enough.\r\n\r\nWe plundered the Famished Main, and recruited 14 happy new crew members. 13 are Petes, the 14th introduced himself as Tanos, obviously an Aasimar, though possessed of a brooding demeanor. Tanos identified a blade taken from him by the Chelish that he \"would do anything to recover.\" I believe that Varnai intends to return it to him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Tideweaver\'s silver tongue was able to attract three additional Chelish Petes and one of the Chelish Marines, who introduced himself as Tomaas, giving us 48 crew members in total, and finally the ability to keep watch \'round-the clock and sail through the night as well as during the day.\r\n\r\nTo deal with the residual crew of the Main, we stripped the ship and remaining crew of all items not essential to sailing operations: weapons, armor, their four ballistae, the full contents of their arsenal, and anything else of an incidental nature, and seized their surplus food stores to leave them only enough food to make landfall nearby.\r\n\r\nAs part of this bounty, we have seized several maps and charts of the region that appear to be more up-to-date and accurate than the ones I\'ve been using. After pointing them in the direction of the nearest land and returning one shovel, we sent them on their way.\r\n\r\nOf note, Captain Tiserond possessed a magical ring and armbands that Varnai said should together provide him protection equivalent to leather armor, and a healing draught Aisla rated as possessing \"improved potency\". We obtained 6 draughts of common strength from the marines. We also seized a masterwork light crossbow and 50 enchanted bolts.\r\n\r\nAs the sun sets and the Famished Main is sailing to the North, what seems like it might be a whaling ship is sighted to the West, riding low on the water.

Today saw sails on the horizon to the northwest. No telling if the scene we encountered was the result of the storm or not, but it certainly is interesting. The closer of the two ships is easily identifiable as a Sargavan Galleon; it is pursued by what is clearly a local Warship, likely a Wyvern-class... This might be one of the Free Captains, but there\'s nothing in local customs that discourages intramural conflicts. The Galleon changes course shortly after catching sight of us, but this provides the Warship with a better chance to close.\r\n\r\nJoining the pursuit, it takes several hours before the Galleon is overtaken and boarded by a horde of pirates. Further, the Devil\'s Pallor is easily carrying several ballistae and catapults which are now aimed roughly at us, now that they\'ve overtaken the Sea Shanty. Neryce reports a count of at least 80 people between the two crews. Ambrose suggests leaving as a feint to circle around to ambush the victors, and we broke off to the west. I unfettered Buster and left him as a tern to observe the fracas, Aisla prepared our initial volley, and the crew made ready for boarding. Buster reported that the count returned by Neryce appears to be slightly low, and the bulk of the numbers appear to be pirates - from what he can tell most of the Sargavan crew has been massacred. 25 minutes in, Buster reported taking fire. I had him fly away from our location and re-summoned him once he was far enough away.\r\n\r\nOur return an hour or so later caught them disentangling themselves from the Sea Shanty, and our approach has apparently gone unnoticed until just before we enter weapons range. Aisla\'s initial salvo destroys their ship\'s wheel and sets fire to their sails, but the Devil\'s Pallor crew manages to put out the fire, and lobs a catapult stone at the Allegiance for minor damage.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial volley where we lost 3 Petes, we continued to exchange fire. Another 3 Petes are slain in the subsequent exchange of shots, but it seems that the crew of the Devil\'s Pallor is showing signs of a break in morale.

Whispered voices muttered about the offer before being told to \'Shut up\' by their captain. He suggested a face-to-face parlay, where we offered him the lives of his remaining crew in exchange for his plunder. He countered by threatening to detonate his ship\'s alchemical stores and blow us all up... Neryce and Varnai tried to distract the Hobgoblin Captain, Gortiss Svard (of the Newport Svards), while Buster polymorphed into a cat to investigate his claims.\r\n\r\nBuster, in weasel form now, reported explicitly seeing, and smelling, only one barrel of Alchemist\'s Fire, upon which news I conferred with Aisla. She indicated that one barrel would not be enough to do more than make our day moderately worse. I advised Varnai to kill Captain Svard if he was not prepared to be reasonable. He commanded his crew to attack at this point, and a brief fracas ensued. Varnai shocked Svard with a Branching Bolt, and Aisla dropped two bombs on his head, felling him tidily. While trying to quell the combat, most efficaciously achieved by Neryce\'s striking appeals, we called for the new Captain, but the barrel Buster had noticed earlier exploded before aught could be done. Varnai shouted an amnesty for fleeing crew, which they generally accepted. With Buster gone from the explosion, I was able to summon three fiendish ponies to aid our plundering.\r\n\r\nWe have lost several Petes, but gained a number of replacements well beyond the necessary volume to replenish our crew. We have obtained a net increase of 18 Petes, as well as the Cook from the Devil\'s Pallor, Blind Ben, giving us a total of 62 crewmembers.  We have also managed to double up on plunder, despite the loss of the Devil\'s Pallor. Varnai ordered a party to celebrate out victory, but as the sun sets, the ship-ahoy call is sounded again, and we recognize the whaler we saw some days ago on the horizon. Again, after it disappears in the sunset, the sound of a single tolling bell echoes across the waves.

Dawn, if it can be called that, has revealed a world shrouded in fog, which deepens as we sail on, rather than being burned off by the sun... It\'s definitely unusual, but I will not permit it to impede repairs any more than necessary. Given the success of Buster\'s unfettered investigation of the fracas yesterday, I have asked him to remain in the form of a tern for easy reconnaissance, though he has complained that today seems ill-suited for an aerial reconnoiter, and that he much prefers his hedgehog form for day-to-day activities, and that poking his nose into things was what got him killed yesterday, but he has conceded the point with good grace that a mobile scout is invaluable.\r\n\r\nAs we wind up the repairs near our best guess at Sunset, for the fog has not lifted, a ship\'s bell is heard tolling nearby, growing louder in the fog... After several minutes, it stops, but the fog is too thick to see any nearby ships - indeed, seeing the water from the rail is a dicey prospect at best. Shortly after the bell ceases its tolling and we are able to hear the creaking and flapping of a ship to port. Off the port bow, a worm-eaten hulk of a ship is visible through the fog. The nameplate \"Deathknell\" is briefly visible before it is lost in the fog again, its bell tolling once more in passing.\r\n\r\nReacting at once, Buster leapt into the air to streak after the departing ship, and I gazed through his eyes as the tip of its mainmast submerged beneath the waves with no apparent reduction in its speed... The rotted sails were visible underwater as the Deathknell continued out of sight into the depths. While I was thusly occupied, Mad Harry related the following tale:<blockquote>The Deathknell is a whaling ship with an insane captain who somehow lost his whole crew, and has been reappearing to hunt other vessels. It\'s said that his stalk transpires over the course of three nights and culminates in an attack, to replenish the crew of his ship and slake his unrelenting hunger...</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI do recall something about the Deathknell being related to an undead horror, but nothing that specific... The last time we spotted this apparition was on the horizon after our encounter with the Famished Main and the Vorsfang, but if Harry\'s account is true, Captain Tiserond and her crew may have fallen prey to the Deathknell. I confess, I feel a twinge of remorse for their fate, if such it was, for we deprived them of any defense save speed, and I gravely doubt that their diminished crew could long have outrun a ghost ship crewed by the tireless dead.\r\n\r\nI suppose that all too soon, we shall discover if <strong>our</strong> crew is able to stave off an attack of the damned...','2015-03-28 01:06:15','2015-03-28 01:07:33'),(54,1,'The Deathknell Encountered','','Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance',8,'4714/09/20','Today\'s dawn sees the fog clear to reveal an angry sky, indicating the advent of a storm.

Varnai spoke to the crew and roused their spirits, and we proceeded handily with securing the ship for the gale.\r\n\r\nThe storm hit in the midafternoon, and while the ship rolled in the storm, a ships\' bell tolling from aft is plainly heard.

He clearly hit, but didn\'t cleave the rope; Buster leapt out to finish the job, successfully, and was caught by Harry before he could fall into the waves.  Almost immediately thereafter, several brine zombies clambered on deck. Such creatures are resistant to fire as well as bludgeoning and piercing weapons. The crew reacted with courage, repelling several of the brine zombies, but the Deathknell resurfaced and launched grapples at our rails...\r\n\r\nIn the teeth of the gale, several more zombies began to scale our hull while the eldritch spirit captaining the Magnimarian whaler clanged away madly at his bell. Looking over the rail, I saw that the captain was alone at the helm and sent Buster to assault him, following after myself in the hopes that it would draw some of the zombies away from our hull, successfully... Harry followed me, while Neryce, Aisla, and Captain Varnai aided the Petes in dispatching the remaining zombies on our decks.

I\'m told that Harry vaulted the rail to the upper deck of the whaler and slew the captain before he could consume my life essence, killing the remaining brine zombies as well it seems. Neryce revived me as the Deathknell began to sink. Unwilling to resign myself to her loss without a look at the hold, I summoned a celestial pony. It dashed below deck to report back finding a whale carcass, several dirty boxes, and a vast mass of human remains.

Sandarra is no worse, possibly slightly better, but still ill. Reef has worsened, while Conchabar has not.

As the Chelish Man\'o\'war reaches the mouth of the cove, it slows and raises a flag signaling the ability to render assistance. The Dominator, as we can now see it named, has dispatched a jolly boat.\r\n\r\nThe man in charge introduces himself as Commander Kayanne Kane and offers the \"aid\" of his ship, under the command of Captain Pericountess Axia Lorvika. Ambrose identifies the Dominator as a pirate-hunter, and observes that the flying of the Plague Flag has probably secured their temporary clemency, that they almost certainly have no plans to board us, and that they are probably looking for surrender and not conquest. Varnai enquired as the the intended nature of the assistance he offered. Commander Kane offered the contribution of medical supplies and stores. Varnai engaged in a careful negotiation, and while it was clear that Commander Kane would have liked to have an agreement to allow some of his men aboard, he accepted our protestations good-naturedly enough.\r\n\r\nWhile this transpires, I pen a hasty message to the village asking for aid and send Buster off to deliver it to the local village headman or shaman person. On his arrival at the large hut, he deposits my missive and nudges it forward towards the guards outside the hut. He waits as they pick up the missive and take it inside. An man somehow intimidating, despite being shunken by age, emerges from the hut and gestures at Buster with his staff. He commands Buster to return to the ship, and sensing his hesitation, intones that he will join us shortly. As Buster wings away, the witch-doctor walks slowly down to and across the water to the Allegiance, levitates up to the deck, and asks if our intention is to leave the village alone if he renders aid. We heartily replied that this was correct, and he forthwith proceeded to the hold to examine our sick. He was able to heal Reef and Conchabar by having his snake suck the disease out of them, by biting their chests.\r\n\r\nA small team of individuals from the Dominator have returned, without Commander Kane, and once again attempt to weasel their way onboard, without success. They do provide us with some supplies, however, and depart. The witch-doctor, meanwhile, has been compensated for his efforts with some of Ambrose\'s best rum, and agrees to return to assist us each day so long as he is compensated and we do not come ashore.\r\n\r\nThe Chelish supplies are most helpful, and two Petes have recovered as a result of their use. Buster\'s flyover of the Dominator has revealed that the ship is steered via a wheel, which for a ship of that size means that it must be hooked up by a rope-and-pulley system, which suggests that if we can disable this system, they would be disabled for several hours.

The waters here are more shallow than on the open sea, as I expected, but the reefs and shoals were more surprising. Still, after weighing anchor and leaving Neryce in command, Varnai set off to visit the native town. Harry, Aisla, Conchabar, Sandarra, and I accompanied him, and were greeted relatively warmly by the natives. Shortly after arriving and stating our intentions (bartering for resupply and the offer to join us for any wandering souls who might take interest), the natives introduced us to their other guest. William Vaashammyr, aka \"The Fish Man\" to the natives, was marooned here some 5 years ago when his ship had its keel detached by a reef. He seems an earnest sort and has expressed interest in accompanying us when we depart.\r\n\r\nThe town is called Y\'kenqu, and we were later introduced to its leader, Ochii. He seems to be the shaman here, leading me to believe that there must be some cultural relation to the village on the sheltered cove where we encountered the Dominator. Ochii does not possess the same kind of presence as that shaman, but the societal structure appears to be similar. During our meal with him, Ochii seemed wary and moderately suspicious of our motives, not unreasonably I suppose, but hopefully our honesty and lack of ulterior motives assuaged his concerns.\r\n\r\nAs we departed, William offered to show us the rough location of his ship when it encountered the reef and sank. The distance from shore he claims to have swam is truly remarkable, but Buster was able to locate the wreck after 8 minutes of searching.

Iron Bert after his storied Ironshirt armor, who lost the bulk of his fleet and his life some ten years ago to Captain Barnabus Harrigan. His widow, despite Harrigan\'s attempts, continued to hold the fortress against his onslaught, until he finally gave up and left her to rot.

Below that, we were conducted to the menagerie proper, a cramped, horrible collection of rare animals kept confined, and in many cases chained, in spaces far too small for them. Amongst the ones that Lacuni gleefully called to our attention were his rust monster, his bulette, his black dragon youngling, and his owlbear. His beast had much less freedom of movement and much closer quarters than Owlbear does on the Allegiance.

We resolved to return after I was able to research the method for transmigrating the construct to the Allegiance.  The next day, a shrouded, hooded man wreathed in an almost palpable air of menace appeared on deck accompanied by two large fire elementals.  He vanished immediately, though Buster was able to get a swipe in at him, and we dispatched the fire elementals without serious difficulty, though there were some tense moments.','2015-06-27 22:09:00','2015-06-27 22:16:51'),(88,1,'Mancatcher Cove Beckons','','Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance',14,'4714/12/02','On our arrival at the cove at dawn (by happy chance), Neryce was able to espy a rocky outcropping that looked a bit like a skull bearded by tree roots and vines.

At the back of this cave, we encountered tree roots with the caricature of a king carved into them beyond earthy soil.

Examination of the map Neryce created from the slain sorceress revealed that we appeared to be in the chambers it detailed; we were able to follow the map to the throne room of the Sahuagin chieftain with well-ordered dispatch. There was a brief moment of trepidation when we offered a shark we had killed to the civilian Sahuagin population to keep them busy. They informed me that this shark was the pet of their chief, Krellort, and that our lives were forfeit. I promised that we would be back shortly with Krellort\'s head, to permit them to devour the shark. While Krellort was highly belligerent, we dispatched him in short order and cleared the caves of further resistance.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the caves, having rescued a Locothah matron and her eggs in the process, we returned to the Allegiance, only to discover her rudder had been disabled and that the Thresher had returned to block the entrance to the cove. The Junk had taken a stand-off position and was firing at the Alligance.\r\n\r\nNeryce boarded the ship to aid its defense, starting with enshrouding the Allegiance with an obscuring mist, while Rakazhan joined us in preparing to assault the Thresher.  We set off at a run across the waves, thanks to Neryce\'s lingering gifts, to board and seize our newest prize.  After a brief exchange of hostilities, with the crew of the Thresher taking the brunt of things, Rakazhan\'s acid and Varnai\'s lightning cleared the decks with dispatch while Buster dealt with the artillery crews, Aisla\'s skill as a grenadier kept the majority of the remaining crew suppressed, and Mad Harry engaged their captain, a punch-ugly galoot with whom he\'d wrangled before.  Blows were exchanged, and the crew might have rallied against us, but Mad Harry scored his second headshot of the day with an egregious blow and the fight went out of them.  A wizened man with a cane emerged on deck, took stock of the fracas, and immediately surrendered the ship unconditionally. We learned his name was Ezekiel, and then saw a vine monster assaulting the Allegiance...\r\n\r\nBuster and Rakazhan leapt into flight, saving a Pete from being dragged up into the foliage, but exposing themselves to the creature\'s attacks.  Mad Harry, Varnai, and Aisla dashed off across the waves again to join the new fracas; I remained to encourage our newest crew to support the attack against the vine monster.  Some of their ballistae crews managed to land shots, while the Captain and Aisla assaulted the creature more directly.

He indicated that he was here to determine Varnai\'s fitness to be received by the Hurricane King, Captain Bonefist. Apparently we\'re to be tested in the practices of piracy.\r\n\r\nThe first test was for one of us to climb to the yardarm of a nearby brig and unfurl the mainsail before Tsadok\'s man managed the same task on the brig\'s mizzenmast. Aisla volunteered and dashed aboard; I think I saw her takea  swig of one of her concoctions \"for luck\"... She casually strolled up to the mainmast, eschewing the rigging, and casually strolled up the mast to the yardarm in a fashion rather at odds with gravity. As she was working on the second knot, Buster alerted me of a sailor meddling with one of the lines for the boom. I tried to ask Tsadok if the man was his, but identifying the fellow was proving challenging until he was assaulted by an angry albatross. Neryce does usually have sharper eyes than Buster... After I was able to point him out, a somewhat annoyed Tsadok admitted the man was his. Aisla encountered no further trouble, though, and moonwalked the last leg of her journey.\r\n\r\nTsadok\'s second challenge was a card game. I confess to the temptation to volunteer and have Buster read his cards to me, but that seemed to be far too easy, as well as something over which Tsadok might take serious exception, so I suggested the Captain take him on instead. Varnai struck me as the sort to be good at card games, and I was not wrong. In spite of a crooked dealer, Varnai was able to win the game handily, taking all of Tsadok\'s 100 platinum sphinxes.  There was minor fluctuation, but after the first hand turned out to be a draw and Varnai won the second, he was never really playing with his own money. Tsadok was a grudging loser, and tried to intimate at the end that as the test was \"just a friendly game\", Varnai could return his platinum now that it was over. I guess the Captain felt like rubbing his nose in the loss, because the way he returned the coins was beautifully magnanimous.\r\n\r\nThe third and final trial was a fight against a marsh giant Tsadok called Fishpork. After roughing him up a bit, Neryce summoned a wall of water and slammed him back into his cage. Buster closed up the cage once more and the fight was essentially over.

It burst through the rotting hull of the wreck, and raked its claws over Harry with wild abandon.  Harry began to behave oddly at this juncture, and Neryce signaled that he was probably dominated.  Harry and the Creature squared off against us, and I focused all of my power in an attempt to dispel its hold over him.  My eldritch strike, though strong and true, was thwarted as easily as a castle turns away the thrust of a child\'s wooden sword, and I knew in that moment how badly in trouble we really were.\r\n\r\nIn desperation I offered myself, in my native tongue as a child of Azlant, in exchange for the freedom of my companions, and hoped that my guess, dread though it might be, was right.\r\n\r\nA brief negotiation followed, and I surrendered myself to the Creature, imploring my Captain and friends to remain with Buster while I descended alone.\r\n\r\nOn being taken below the shelf on which the wreckage lay, the Creature\'s guise was revealed to be a veil for my most ancient enemy, an aboleth: I had been right...\r\n\r\nI hoped to be able to bargain for my death, rather than for a lifetime of servitude, but I was surprised again, this time by the creature\'s demand: it wanted information regarding the whereabouts of the Dark Councilor.  It tried to threaten me with death, first my own (how foolish as I\'m the only one who knows for sure how to find the thing) and then with the deaths of my companions (a bluff I called, since Harry is really no match for either Neryce or Varnai alone, let alone together).  The aboleth was desperate enough that it tried to reason with me.  It was at this juncture that I started to taunt it.  I mocked its attempts to obtain this so-sought-after information, and instead provided it with the news of Sandarra\'s vision as an additional reason for it to release my companions...  After relating the vision, the aboleth became even more agitated, and demanded to know what exactly the Dark Councilor had said to us.\r\n\r\nNonplussed at this abrupt turn of events, I blurted out that it had offered a pact, and had seemed desperate, almost pathetically so, to have one of us enter into an agreement with it, but that none of us had.\r\n\r\nThe aboleth released me then, and said that we were free to go.  Then it left in haste for the depths.\r\n\r\nWe spent the bulk of the rest of the day loading the gold into the Allegiance.  I was very quiet.  I\'ve been very quiet ever since, really...','2015-12-21 01:12:21','2015-12-21 01:16:01'),(111,1,'Count your Petes','','Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance',17,'4715/02/25','Our return to Ollo was uneventful, and after offloading the share of the bullion due to Doc Fitch and acquiring additional supplies, Varnai ordered our departure for Beachcomber the following day.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"cypher\" style=\"display: none;\">The notion of providing Slip with some excerpts of our interactions with the Gods Hammer in exchange for additional information about its crew and/or mission is an idea that continues to taunt me each night...

There may be an extra Pete aboard, though nobody seems to be able to locate anyone they don\'t recognize.  Varnai ordered a quiet but detailed headcount, and I am now worried that the aboleth may have recalled one of my taunts and put it to good use...  I seem to recall suggesting that a better way to have gone about trying to locate the Dark Councillor would have been to quietly take over a Pete and observe the crew for some time.\r\n\r\nI seem to recall the aboleth saying that our group would not be molested further, but I may have misunderstood his intent, or he may have been lying to me, or he may have passed the suggestion along to the Archmage.

We also informed him of the divine vision Sandarra had been granted, warning of the destruction of the Shackles.\r\n\r\nToday we\'ve re-supplied and visited Slip.

He advised that we turn our attention to one Haddon Pike, Master of a merchant craft called the Grimgrin, who lives in a bungalow overlooking the water just north of the docks.  Keft commented that Pike seems to have a unique talent for running with an empty hold both coming <b>and</b> going...\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at his home, we found Pike to be rather dead, face-down in his fish tank. I conjured a trio of Pharasma\'s Nosoi scribes, appropriate company for the Day of Bones, to help me question his corpse.  His answers were not always the most intelligible, but we were able to learn a good deal...  Pike had no knowledge of his killer, but was indeed a spy working for a woman named Kelet, watching the Master of Gales. He was recently supposed to have met Ms. Kelet in Hell Harbor, an appointment he had not kept.\r\n\r\nNeryce also questioned Pike\'s fish, some sort of Dire Piranha, who indicated that Pike had fallen face-first into the tank, after which Grinner ate his face.  We took Grinner for the Allegiance, and also extracted a waterproof bag from underneath his tank.\r\n\r\nThe bag contained a large sum of platinum and gold, an ornate scrimshaw tube holding several scrolls, and several encoded log books.  Once I decrypted the logs (an easy enough task), they seemed to confirm his spying activities.  The document in the scroll case, on the other hand, was an incomplete copy of the infamous Chelish Opera, the Trials of Larazod, but written in Infernal.  Comparing the translation to my recollection of the High-Common copy from the Great Library in Absolom, either the translation was done very poorly or this is more than it seems.\r\n\r\nAisla, meanwhile, had examined the crossbow bolts protruding from Pike\'s back and pronounced them coated with a thin but deadly dose of Deathblade poison.  Clearly, Pike\'s death was executed with malice aforethought.  Varnai has ordered us all back to the ship to wait for Kipper, Fipps, and their Petes to arrive from Hell Harbor.\r\n\r\nOn the journey to Drenchport, we first attempted to Scry on Master Vaashammyr as we had before, but this proved fruitless.  From Neryce\'s description of the difficulty, there is some active effect blocking her magic...  The second attempt was much more helpful, though, as we were able to focus on Fipps Chumlet, who seemed to be trying to keep a low profile at a bar with Kipper.  Varnai and I worked to establish a whispering conduit through Neryce\'s divination, and once we did Fipps nearly blew their cover.  We were able to learn from Kipper and Fipps that Vaashammyr and a good portion of the crew of the Redemption had been captured by the Lord of Hell Harbor, Arronax Endymion, as Chelish spies, while the Redemption itself lay impounded.  Varnai ordered Kipper to learn as much as he could and then gather the remaining free crew to join us in Drenchport...','2016-01-09 23:13:29','2016-01-10 02:07:09'),(114,1,'A Dank Departure','','Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance',18,'4715/03/06','I\'ve finished decoding the infernal text of the opera, and it validates all of the things that we were told by the dead man himself...

Pike was to periodically report back to Hell Harbor with his findings.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve rendezvoused with Kipper, Fipps, and their Petes, which means we can leave Drenchport.  Varnai had a small crew of Petes join him, Aisla, Neryce, and myself in sailing the Grimgrin to Hell Harbor to continue our investigations.

Kelet is apparently a harbormaster; the best place to learn more about our erstwhile crew was the Copper Cauldron, the tavern where most of the Keep\'s Guardsmen choose to unwind after their shifts are over.  We went in disguise, and met a number of helpful guards.\r\n\r\nThey seemed quite taken with my blonde alter-ego, Alina, and I managed to keep a number of them distracted.  Varnai was more urbane, though, and managed to strike up a conversation with a trio of sergeants. We discovered that while Vaashammyr was captured and apparently has been questioned repeatedly, he has not been executed and is being kept in the high security area of the keep.  We also discovered that Lord Arronax Endymion, was recently joined by a mysterious woman from whom he receives and follows a great deal of advice, a troubling tidbit.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve resolved to investigate Rowina Kelet tomorrow, while trying to puzzle out how to rescue Vaashammyr.','2016-03-12 23:59:35','2016-03-13 01:02:38'),(116,1,'Hell Hath No Fury...','','Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance',18,'4715/03/09','With the location of the warehouse overseen by Rowina Kelet in our possession, we\'ve made our way down to the docks to discover a quiet quay and a single guard.  The warehouse seems to be closed.  Varnai, disguised as \'Griswold Pike\', was less than successful in gaining access to the warehouse, so I introduced myself to him disguised as Helena.  I claimed to be Rowina\'s cousin and said that I was trying to find her.  Guardsman Tom was kindness itself, and we chatted for some time.  I learned that Rowina was missing, but that it was suspected that she was dead.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Neryce took the form of a shore bird and slipped into the warehouse.  Once she overheard Tom admit that he had never met Ms. Kelet, Neryce adopted a more matronly disguise and emerged while I pretended to recognize her.  Neryce was rather more striking, somehow, and Tom seemed to be seriously distracted by it; we departed without any issues.  There were some very interesting ledgers we managed to retrieve.  One of them lists all of the Pirate Lords ranked by some numeric value, a dash, or a question mark.  Some names were also marked \'Send with Corlan\', presumably a courier.  Some asking around discreetly pointed us at Corlan the Tengu, a resident of the Rookery district.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the address in the Rookery after collecting a worrisome number of misgiving looks from the tengu residents.  Their opinion of us surely was not improved by the two crossbow bolts that lodged in the sternum of our now-deceased host, Corlan the Tengu.  Neryce caught sight of the assassin on a nearby rooftop, and I opened a portal to let us cut off his escape.  We made short work of him, and recovered his instructions to kill Pike, Kelet, and Corlan, then return to his employer.  With additional assistance from another three of Pharasma\'s Nosoi clerks, I was able to obtain some additional information from the assassin and from Corlan.\r\n\r\nZoskia Galimbar is the next link in the chain, apparently running this spy ring from her base in PortPeril, the Jasperleaf Apothecary.  She sent the assassin to kill her agents, Rowina Kelet, Haddon Pike, and Corlan the courier.  Corlan was last used as a courier 19 days ago, when he left Hell Harbor for Quent.\r\n\r\nThis is all wonderful progress in our task for our patron, but we still have a rescue to plan...','2016-03-13 00:56:12','2016-03-13 02:24:29'),(117,1,'A Plan Forged in Hell','','Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance',18,'4715/03/10','To rescue Vaashammyr, I\'ve attempted to forge an infernal text of the Trials of Larazod, the opera in which Pike had his encoded instructions.

Tina arranged an audiance for us with Arronax for 4 days from now, just before lunch.  This should give me just enough time to finish a magical bag for us...  I\'ve also located a Cleric of Shelyn, called Marette, to be able to accompany us to the audience and cast Zone of Truth if necessary.  Marette is, I\'m told, a slightly distracted young elven woman with oddly functional wind chimes for earrings, meaning that she melodicaly jangles at almost all times.

The audience went ... badly.  I overestimated both the degree to which the Lord of Hell Harbor was mired in the manipulative clutches of his newest adviser, as well as his willingness to listen to reason.  He seemed wholly unsurprised when the woman revealed herself to be our nemesis Alys from the Demons of Avarice incident.  In the ensuing fracas, it provides some consolation to record that we were able to hold our own against the Red Mantis Assassin, to her ultimate undoing in telltale swirls of red mist.\r\n\r\nArronax was furious, and redoubled his efforts against us, apparently he had been hoping to take advantage of an alliance with Ilizmagorti in some fashion.  Seeing that we were clearly overmatched, we made a hasty retreat.  Our successful departure was no doubt aided by the confusion and disarray caused by my parting gift: a fine, tall, strong oak tree ... in the doorway to the audience chamber.\r\n\r\nWhile I rode Buster into the clear afternoon sky, Neryce was able to take the form of some sort of massive bird to carry Aisla and Varnai back to the Allegiance.

The initial conference went well, I thought, but almost immediately after she left to \'attend to an experiment\', the potted plant exploded in a cloud of poison, and her guards descended upon us.  By the time we secured their surrender and made our way upstairs, the spymistress had escaped.  She left us a plaything for Buster, though, in the form of some sort of hell-cat abomination.  Additionally, we were able to recover some of her papers she had tried to destroy...  The most intelligible one, dated roughly three weeks ago and written in infernal, read as follows:\r\n\r\n<small>Silence is now key, our plans will go into full force once our agent finishes his preparations.

Per Slip\'s suggestion, we are planning to pay a visit to Lord Wolfgang Starling, the keeper of the enchanted, intelligent violin Amadeus, in the hope that it might shed additional light on the God\'s Hammer Situation.

Though we had made no appointment, he was more than happy to invite us in; apparently our reputation has preceded us even insofar as the landed gentry of Port Peril are concerned.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the platinum magnate takes a good deal of pleasure in introducing his guests to Amadeus, on display in the Plum Study, so our task was quite pleasantly accomplished.  We found that in order to speak, Amadeus must be played, a task initially taken up by Lord Wolfgang himself.  We explained the nature of our quest, and Amadeus agreed to hear our story.  Hoping to protect the nature of the tale, I did my best to present the story in High Celestial of the Seventh Mode.  I must have acquitted myself reasonably well, as Amadeus seemed to understand our quest.  By the time I finished, we had been joined by Lissy Starling, to whom her father graciously surrendered the violin.  The change was both immediate and astounding.\r\n\r\nWhere Wolfgang had merely allowed Amadeus to play itself, Lissy\'s playing fully engaged with the violin to produce an effect far more potent than before.  As the music ebbed and swelled, the Plum Study around us was subsumed into a different scene.  We were standing in what was clearly an arcane research laboratory, in the center of a smallish but well-appointed cottage.  The house was set on a hill, or rise of some sort, overlooking a picturesque coastal town.  The scene came to life as the figure of a man holding a violin began to speak.  The man, who was indistinct enough that I could not reliably describe him yet at the same time seemed almost too familiar, was apologizing to the violin for having to leave so abruptly, but explained that his time to act was very short and he could not afford to pass up the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe scene froze, then, as Amadeus introduced us to his last keeper, the mage Bartholomew.  The lilting melody explained that the arcanist had sought immortality, but found necromancy repugnant, and had therefore turned to the study of intelligent magical items.  Amadeus had initially been intended only as an instrument for study, but the magician and the violin had bonded over their shared musical preference for Merrion\'s Taldan Waltz in G minor.\r\n\r\nThe scene was limited by the violin\'s perceptions, but there were some sufficiently constant elements that we were able to examine them.  One book kept next to Amadeus in the cottage was titled \"Principles of Unnatural Longevity\" but had no indicated author.  Another book addressed necromantic processes; Amadeus explained that Bartholomew had been trying to permute these with the intent of preserving his soul, but had ultimately abandoned the project as utterly infeasible.  Another sheet of parchment read as follows:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"Mira appears capable of assuming humaniod form, of a sort, implications? Duke arguably humanoid, not really, look into it.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere was one last memory that Amadeus was able to share...  The vision went dark, and the voices around us were muffled, as though coming from outside a violin case.  Another voice, rougher and deeper than Bartholomew\'s, speaks first: \"Bart, are yeh sure about this?  I don\'t know wha ta do with him...\"  The wizard replies, with conviction: \"That\'s ok, I have to follow my destiny.\"  As the vision faded back into the Plum Study, Amadeus indicated, as a guess, that the first speaker was Gorven, a dwarf who had occasionally run errands for his friend some 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Lissy stopped playing and we retired to the East Room for lunch.  We chatted for a time, complimenting her playing, and then she asked if we would be entering the Free Captains\' Regatta, as it seems that the Master of Gales will be the Arbiter this year, rather than a contestant, and therefore others have a chance to win.  The winner, from what I\'ve heard, takes a large purse of gold, rights to govern a small island, and a seat on the Pirate Council.  As one of the newest Free Captains, Varnai would doubtless garner a great deal of attention and notoriety if we should win, but I recall with some trepidation the fates of some of the mythological figures whose meteoric rise to power was followed abruptly by an even swifter fall...\r\n\r\nBased on the traditional timing, we should have just enough time to visit Quent and Beachcomber before returning to Port Peril for the announcement of the starting location for the Regatta a week from now...','2016-03-15 01:14:11','2016-03-15 02:54:39'),(121,1,'Rushed Round-Trip','','Ship\'s Log: The Allegiance',20,'4715/03/24','We set sail for Quent almost directly from Lord Starling\'s manor, to make our report to the Lady Fairwind.
